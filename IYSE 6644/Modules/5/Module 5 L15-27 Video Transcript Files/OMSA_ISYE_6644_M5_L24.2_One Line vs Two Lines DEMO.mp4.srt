1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,535
Now we're gonna be demoing this
one line versus two line problem.

2
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:07,681
On the top here, I'll actually run it,

3
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:11,160
I've got one line feeding
into two parallel servers.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,234
On the bottom,
I split the customers evenly,

5
00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:19,004
50/50, into two separate servers.

6
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:22,652
So let's watch customers arrive here,
I can zoom in, you can see the little,

7
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:24,840
marbles coming in, the blue marbles.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,962
Parts arrive to the system, I assign
a server time to them right away, so

9
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:32,692
wherever they go, they're going
to have the same service time.

10
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:36,347
They're gonna have
the same arrival time so

11
00:00:36,347 --> 00:00:42,900
these are the same exact customers that
I split into two identical clones.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:49,000
So this is a separate duplicate original,
Duplicate original and these are clones.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,570
One clone goes up here into the single
line feeding into two parallel servers,

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,430
the other clone goes here and this
decide block mainly it's a 50/50 side,

15
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,290
splits into the two parallel servers.

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:10,091
The single drilling center up here is
a resource center with capacity two.

17
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:14,728
So basically the only difference
is capacity two, single line,

18
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:19,300
two separate lines,
each of which go into server capacity one.

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:25,540
So the only things I care about now
are the average number in the queues,

20
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:32,010
so looks like so far I've got 1.23
customers average number in this queue,

21
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,250
and looks like 0.11 here, 2.116 here.

22
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,962
So in this system I've got
2.3 as opposed to 1.6,

23
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:43,777
little hard to see these numbers,
and the cycle times for

24
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:48,008
option A are 16 cycle time for
option B are 21.

25
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:52,058
But what's going on is that
this simulation is very,

26
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:55,860
very early it's only 166 minutes.

27
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,640
Let's run it more quickly I'm zooming here

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,030
now we're at a 1000
minutes now 3,000 minutes.

29
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,540
And you can see, these queues on average,
average number in

30
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,300
queue's about 7 when you add them up,
only about 2 when you add them up here.

31
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,120
And the cycle times down in option B are
twice as much as the cycle times up here.

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,754
Let's run this thing to completion.

33
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:21,109
I think I run it for some 100,000 minutes,
some huge number of minutes.

34
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,286
On it goes, I'll stall, stall,
stall, I think it goes to 100,000.

35
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:31,704
We're at 60,000, 70,000, 80,000,
and let's see what we get.

36
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:36,287
It goes even further than that,
so I'm gonna,

37
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:38,850
what I'll do is I'll run it in batch mode.

38
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,271
So Run Control > Batch, Run it.

39
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:46,760
And whatever the number was,

40
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,930
it was quite a long time and
let's see some of the output here.

41
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:58,552
So, you can see that,
We have just as huge number of runs,

42
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:03,942
and each drilling center
had a drilling center one,

43
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:10,802
these are the two separate guys,
this is the drilling center one,

44
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:15,579
drilling center two
the two single servers and

45
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:20,384
single drilling center
is the double server.

46
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:26,302
So they have about the same number,
And these are the number in and out.

47
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:33,798
So the statistics I'm interested
in are the waiting times and

48
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:38,313
single drilling center this
is with two parallel servers,

49
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:42,030
41 minutes that's
the average waiting time.

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,995
And the two single
server lines option B is

51
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:53,550
almost it's even more than 200 minutes.

52
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,820
Unbelievable, so
there's a huge difference, and

53
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,750
I would definitely use
Option A just by looking at this.

54
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,600
Okay, you can play around with this
a little bit more if you want, but

55
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,990
the story is pretty clear,
option A definitely beats option B.
