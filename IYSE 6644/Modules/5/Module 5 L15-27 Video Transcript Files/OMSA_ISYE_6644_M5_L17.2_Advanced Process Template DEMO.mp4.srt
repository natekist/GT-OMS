1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:05,812
Well now we're gonna look at the Seize,
Delay, Release,

2
00:00:05,812 --> 00:00:09,140
actually just the Seize Release example,

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,930
as our demo to introduce
the Advanced Process template.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,450
This is short and sweet,
very straightforward, very easy.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,880
What I'm gonna do here,
is I'm gonna use separate Seize and

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,150
Release blocks to do overlapping
seizes and releases.

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,235
So what do I mean by that?

8
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:30,630
Well, let's just take a look here.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,440
Let's run the thing for a second.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,820
I've set this up, and
you can have access to that.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,990
So a bunch of customers here, and they're
lining up at this Process, getting served.

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,040
Not sure if it's a barber shop or
whatever, I'll look into it in a minute.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,470
But look at this.

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,450
It doesn't seem that there's ever
a line forming at this Process.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,500
And why is that?

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,893
Well, here's what I'm doing.

17
00:00:54,662 --> 00:01:00,730
I've got a line forming in front of this
Process, where I do a Seize and Delay.

18
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,680
And then this Seize is for that Process.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,530
This Release is for that Process.

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,404
So a customer can't go through and

21
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:17,215
therefore cannot release the server until

22
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:22,436
a slot is ready over
here in Process number 2.

23
00:01:22,436 --> 00:01:24,756
That's why no alliance forming over here,

24
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:27,209
all the line gets pushed
back over to this guy.

25
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:30,260
There is no line now, but if there
was a line it's gonna be over here.

26
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,620
So lets see exactly what I did.

27
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,361
This is very short and sweet like I said.

28
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:37,990
Create the customer in the usual way.

29
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,960
Seize, Delay, Release, so for
Seize Delay, there's no Release here.

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,900
For once it's not a barber, Resource 1.

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,900
So I just do Seize Delay.

32
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,560
This is a Seize block that I got
from the Advanced Process template.

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,330
Seize and just dragged it over.

34
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,100
It comes with its own queue.

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,570
But since there is no queue,
you don't see one appear here or here.

36
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,976
Then in this release,
I release Resource 1.

37
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:10,780
And now in Process 2,
I've already seized it at this point.

38
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,920
I do Delay Release and
all the customers go off hap hap happy.

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,411
So again,
I'll show it to you one more time.

40
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:20,130
There you go, see?

41
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,670
All the queue is relegated to this area.

42
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,940
Now, one thing I promised
to do is show you,

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,610
remind you how you get
the Advanced Process template.

44
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,780
It may be easier for you than for me.

45
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,390
But I always go to File >
Template Panel > Attach.

46
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,150
And then you start looking around, and

47
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,770
since the last time I looked around,
I actually got to the Template Panel.

48
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,140
Eventually it remembered that and
here I am.

49
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,860
So look at all these things I could get.

50
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,060
I'm just gonna get the AdvancedProcess,

51
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,432
which I clicked on that's why I
have the panel sitting to my left.

52
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,990
And I could also got AdvancedTransfer,
BasicProcess, which is,

53
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,481
we already have blocks which you'll
see a couple of lessons from now, etc,

54
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:01,830
etc, very very nice.
