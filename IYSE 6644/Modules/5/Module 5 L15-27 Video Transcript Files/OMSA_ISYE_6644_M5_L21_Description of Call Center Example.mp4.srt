1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,874
[BLANK AUDIO] Now it's finally time to
do this call center example that I've

2
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:06,760
been hawking the last few lessons.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,907
Let's just jump right into it.

4
00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:10,969
The lesson overview is as follows.

5
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:15,726
In the last lesson, I mainly discussed
how to use resource sets along with

6
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:18,870
the Seize-Delay-Release capability.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,839
And remember,
we have to be a little careful.

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,220
The reason I did that is because that's a
key component to the call center example.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,886
You'll see that in a while, careful.

10
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:30,183
In this lesson,

11
00:00:30,183 --> 00:00:36,030
I'm gonna just describe in plain English
what the call center example is.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,307
We've been waiting for this all along.

13
00:00:38,307 --> 00:00:43,235
And when we're done with this, you can
actually start being a consultant if

14
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:47,085
you want, because I think this
problem is general enough so

15
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:50,403
that you can do a wide class
of practical problems.

16
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:53,308
And I really, really mean that.

17
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:57,750
So let's start out with the call
center description in plain English.

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,598
First of all,
the program is arranged in submodels.

19
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:06,853
A submodel is just sort of a subroutine
that undertakes a specific

20
00:01:06,853 --> 00:01:11,742
task in the program that would
otherwise take a lot of space.

21
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:15,167
And you'll see that submodels
save space in the screen.

22
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:16,571
This is what one looks like.

23
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:19,758
You click inside of it, and
you see all sorts of good Arena stuff.

24
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:22,274
It just saves a lot of
space on the screen.

25
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:24,700
In the various submodels,
here's what you'll do.

26
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,003
You'll use one submodel to create and
direct arrivals.

27
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:30,993
So how often do arrivals show up?

28
00:01:30,993 --> 00:01:33,345
Calls, and where do they go?

29
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:38,040
Do they go to Tech Support,
or Sales, or whatever?

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,814
Then we have a tech support submodel,

31
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:44,029
where we handle all
the tech support calls.

32
00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:47,655
So in particular,
what kind of tech support do you need?

33
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:50,797
Turns out there are gonna be three
different types of products in this model.

34
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:55,990
It also turns out that some of the tech
support calls require return calls.

35
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,480
So that's another submodel.

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,520
Sometimes, the guy's gotta call you
back cuz he doesn't know the answer.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,861
We'll also have some sales calls, order
status calls, is my order ready to go?

38
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:10,830
And a time period counter, what one
half-hour period of the day is it?

39
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,160
We'll be using fake customers to
increment the time period counter,

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,880
we've seen that trick before.

41
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,870
Let's look at arrivals,

42
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,480
calls show up according to
a nonhomogeneous Poisson process.

43
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,303
So we're gonna have to schedule arrivals.

44
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:27,383
The call center accepts
calls from 8AM till 6PM.

45
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:30,590
The arrival rates change every half-hour.

46
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,600
Here's a table below that I sort
of plagiarized from the book.

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,625
So you can look at that table,

48
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:43,336
and you'll see that the call
frequencies change every half-hour.

49
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:47,338
And also, I'll show you in the demo
how to use the Arrival Schedule in

50
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:50,450
the Basic Process template
to type these numbers in.

51
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,010
So during the first half-hour period,
we'll have a rate of 20 calls per hour.

52
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,305
In the second half-hour period, 8:30 to 9,
the rate goes up to 35 calls per hour.

53
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,630
By the way,
did you notice that I said calls per hour?

54
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,065
A little warning sign there.

55
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:08,968
These rates are per hour even though
the time intervals are 30 minutes.

56
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:10,978
Just a little trick you have to remember.

57
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:12,167
That's Arena for you.

58
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:16,176
A few staff actually stay at
work until 7PM in order to

59
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:20,286
let those calls that came
near 6 o'clock filter out.

60
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:21,660
I do that all the time.

61
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,809
I call just before the call center closes,

62
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:29,798
which is stupid, but they just
don't hang up on you at 6 o'clock.

63
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:33,055
They have to patiently get you through.

64
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:37,922
So what you have to do though is, given
that there are no calls between 6 and

65
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:42,637
7, originating at least, you have
to explicitly model 0 arrivals for

66
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:46,449
those last half-hour segments
of the Arrival Schedule.

67
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:50,530
So with the phone lines,
it turns out we have 26 of them.

68
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,818
If you get a busy signal,
you balk and get out of there.

69
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,226
So a busy signals kill you off
immediately, 26 is the limit.

70
00:03:57,226 --> 00:03:59,807
Now what we'll do is
we'll use a Queue block.

71
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,780
We actually did a demo on precisely this.

72
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,324
We're gonna use a Queue block with
capacity 0 to try to seize a line.

73
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:11,034
So what that does,
if the seize of these 26 lines fails.

74
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:13,710
In other words,
if 26 lines are all being used,

75
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,906
there ain't no place to go in the hotel,
and you check out.

76
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:20,543
So the Queue will immediately kick
you out cuz it's got a capacity of 0.

77
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:22,770
This is a nice little trick.

78
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,440
The Queue and the Seize both come from the
Blocks template, we did a demo on that.

79
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,698
And this is the only place where
you get a Queue block, and

80
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:33,638
it only connects to this kind of Seize.

81
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:37,125
We explicitly did this in an old demo,
okay?

82
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:42,210
So recall that if you use a Seize within
a Process module in the Basic Process

83
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,053
template and the other type of Seize
in the Advanced Process template,

84
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:51,060
you can't connect it up with
a Queue block, so too bad.

85
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,636
That trick only works,
a Queue block only works in this case,

86
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:58,644
with a Seize block, not a Seize module.

87
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:01,627
3 general types of calls,
they come in randomly.

88
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:04,928
We'll handle them with an N-way
by Chance Decide module.

89
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:07,280
So each customer hears a recording.

90
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,947
They hear the little music,
what type of call do you wanna make?

91
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:12,720
And then he makes his choice of call.

92
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,922
76%, like the number of trombones in
the big parade, go to Tech Support,

93
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:17,902
16 go to Sales.

94
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:21,928
It turns out there are 7 identical,
faceless vanilla Sales guys that

95
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:25,970
we'll need to schedule as a group of 7,
not on an individual basis.

96
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,412
And the sales calls take a Triangular
amount of time, unimportant.

97
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,455
And then 8% go to Order Status.

98
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:33,430
Is my order ready, basically?

99
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,605
You do all that all of the time
when you call up these places.

100
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:38,658
Most callers do self-service in
a Triangular amount of time.

101
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:42,620
But some callers, about 15% of
those guys going to Order Status,

102
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,713
need a real Sales guy for
a Triangular amount of time.

103
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:46,937
Now let's look at Tech Support.

104
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:48,810
This is the best part of the program.

105
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,430
There are three different
types of tech support calls.

106
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,290
Again, we'll handle these via by choice,
a Decide module.

107
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,354
These are random Decides to go
to the three different types

108
00:05:58,354 --> 00:05:59,612
of Tech Support calls.

109
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:05,680
25% are for Product 1, 34% are Product 2,
41% are for Product 3.

110
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,084
Each customer gets a little piece of
music while they make their choice.

111
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:13,961
And all Tech Support calls require
staff for this Triangular 3, 6,

112
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:15,624
18 duration of time.

113
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:18,930
We can make each type of call require
a different amount of time, but

114
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,788
this is already complicated enough.

115
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:22,500
There are some call backs.

116
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,229
4% of Tech Support calls require
additional investigation.

117
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:29,812
So the Tech Support guy you
talk to may not be able

118
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:32,507
to handle your request right away.

119
00:06:32,507 --> 00:06:37,158
And this additional investigation is
actually carried out by another group of

120
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:39,561
staff that we are not gonna worry about.

121
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:44,844
So what happens is you talk to your
server, Sammy, or Tierney, or whoever.

122
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:47,800
They can't answer your questions so
they ask their boss.

123
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,292
Once they ask their boss, Tierney,
or Sammy, or whoever you talk to,

124
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:53,054
is freed up to talk to other people.

125
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:55,027
They hang up on you for a while.

126
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:59,832
The boss does some work, and then they
tell the answer to Sammy, or Tierney, or

127
00:06:59,832 --> 00:07:03,100
whoever you talk to, and
then they call you back.

128
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,505
Investigation by the boss,
who we don't care about,

129
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:08,878
takes an EXPO one hour amount of time.

130
00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:13,347
And then at that point, the original
Tech Support guy gets the information from

131
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:17,614
boss, and they call the customer back
using one of the 26 phone lines, but

132
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:18,829
with high priority.

133
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:19,847
There's no busy signal.

134
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:22,840
They wait till the first one's
available and then they call you.

135
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,930
That return call takes
a Triangular amount of time.

136
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,690
Now let's talk about Tech Support.

137
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,475
Tech Support guys have
some interesting issues.

138
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:33,061
They all have 8 hour days,
30 minutes for lunch, and

139
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:34,900
they all have different schedules.

140
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,872
Every one of them has
a different schedule.

141
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:42,616
And so we'll need the Resource Schedules
spreadsheet to model these

142
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:44,710
guys on an individual basis.

143
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,314
They all have different product expertise.

144
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:51,150
So we'll need Sets to model this,
and we've talked about this before.

145
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,380
Here the preferred orders for the set and

146
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,080
we actually gave an example
of this in previous lesson.

147
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,030
Product 1 can be handled by Charity, Noah,
Molly in blue, Anna, and Sammy in red.

148
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,510
Product 2, Tierney, Sean, Emma,
Anna and then Sammy, again, same guys.

149
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:12,582
Product 3, Shelley, Jenny, Christie,
Molly in blue, Anna, and Sammy in red.

150
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:15,587
Molly, by the way,
turns out was a Math major in real life.

151
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:20,458
You can see the cross functionality that
we had alluded to before in the previous

152
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,047
lesson.

153
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:26,120
Here is the schedule of
the various Tech Support staff.

154
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,736
They're all listed on the left.

155
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:31,064
All the products they can handle
are listed in the Products column.

156
00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:33,690
And then that mess is their schedule.

157
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,968
You can see every one of them has
a little lunch somewhere in there.

158
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:38,772
So here's a summary of what we did.

159
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:41,875
We're gonna do the demo
in a separate lesson.

160
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:46,470
I gave a long, tedious verbal
description of the Call Center model.

161
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,139
That was the only purpose of this lesson.

162
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,003
Next time, it's Gigantic Demo Time, and

163
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:56,538
we're gonna get to see this Arena program
finally in all of its full glory.

164
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:59,680
And you can see that we're
putting together a lot of stuff.

165
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,601
Everything is actually easy, and

166
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:04,788
we just have to be patient
about putting it all together.

167
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:06,625
So you'll see it's a really fun demo.

168
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,457
And I guarantee,

169
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:11,670
you play around with it a little bit, you
are a consultant by the time it's over.

170
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,969
So let's sit back, relax, and
we'll look at the demo in the next lesson.

171
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:18,066
So see you then.

172
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:25,399
