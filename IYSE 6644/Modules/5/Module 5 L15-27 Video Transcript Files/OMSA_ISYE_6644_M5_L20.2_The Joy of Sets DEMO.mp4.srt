1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,850
In this demo I'm gonna
show how you use sets

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,070
with a small example involving
four different servers.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,850
So let's just watch this for a second.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,710
Just a simple seize delay release, and
it looks like I've got these four barbers.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,210
And I'm gonna have the four barbers be
used in preferred order, A, B, C, D.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,390
So A goes first, then B,
then C, then D if possible.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,140
So just, let's watch.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,338
They're all being used here.

9
00:00:27,338 --> 00:00:32,270
And let's see,
you'll see that I'm gonna attempt to fill

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,560
in the left-most zeros
first if there's a tie.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,800
So right now there's no tie.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,820
There's a zero,
he gets filled in immediately.

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,850
See, when we had two zeros,
the one on the left gets filled in first.

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,785
Just watch carefully.

15
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:47,810
When the queue builds down,
we'll see some zeroes.

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,280
Eventually the queue will build down,
we hope.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,622
Come on, let's go.

18
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:55,920
Zero, [LAUGH] it takes
a little longer than we think.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,670
See, lots of zeroes,
left, left, left, left.

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,740
See how that works?

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,130
So these queues get handled and

22
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,520
the seized resources get
handled in the preferred order.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,640
All right,
well let's look at some details here.

24
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,680
First of all,
I'm gonna show you how I set up the set.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,580
Set, Barbers, and
Barbers is a set with four rows.

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,910
Let's click and see the members.

27
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,950
Barber A, B, C, D, as I promised.

28
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,910
Not very imaginative names,
but what can I say.

29
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:36,350
And now let's look at the language that
I have to use in the seize and release.

30
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,750
Remember they were awful looking.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,830
So here's the seize, and what I did is I
added this line in plain English it says,

32
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,340
seize one guy from the set called Barbers.

33
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,080
I want to seize that guy in
preferred order, A, B, C, D.

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,860
And I'm going to store whoever
I seize in the Barber Index.

35
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,730
And let's suppose,
I is customer number 17, C is Barber B.

36
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,667
When customer 17 is done,
he will release Barber B.

37
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:14,322
Okay, then we go through the delay,
just standard boring delay.

38
00:02:14,322 --> 00:02:18,314
And then I release that specific guy,
click, click.

39
00:02:18,314 --> 00:02:24,230
So I've added the release in
from the set called Barber 1.

40
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,400
From the set called Barbers,
I released one guy,

41
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,760
the specific member who's
stored in the Barber index.

42
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,480
So if you want I can look at this
more carefully by clicking Edit.

43
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,390
And that has it,
you can see all the letters this way.

44
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,200
If I wanted to I could do other releases.

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,540
You don't want to do this necessarily
because you'll release random guys.

46
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,960
But in this case I used a specific member.

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,580
So very nice, very easy.

48
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,070
I'll let you see this one more time.

49
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,550
This is just keeping track of which
server A, B, C, or D is being used.

50
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,874
And again, C goes from left to right,

51
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:09,000
we fill in the left most zeros first cuz
we wanna use A, B, C, D in that order.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,702
Very, very simple.

53
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:12,030
You can go play along with
this model at your leisure.
