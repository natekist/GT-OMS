1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,650
What we'll be doing in this
lesson is talking about

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,250
the Advanced Process Template.

3
00:00:07,282 --> 00:00:07,796
Here's the overview.

4
00:00:07,796 --> 00:00:14,446
Last lesson, I talked about fake customers
and we explained how they can be used for

5
00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:20,441
a variety of purposes including the users
of arrival of breakdown demons.

6
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:24,460
They can be used for other things, but
we'll talk about it in upcoming lessons.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,707
In this lesson, we're gonna add to
our arsenal of vocabulary modules

8
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:32,570
by introducing the advanced
process template.

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,410
None of this is basic stuff any more.

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,158
That's UGA, University of Georgia stuff.

11
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:39,578
Now, we're gonna do advance
Georgia Tech stuff.

12
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:43,928
Advanced process template and the idea is
that we'll get lots of great new stuff,

13
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:47,220
although I don't expect you to
have to memorize everything.

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,600
You'll look at a bunch
of important things and

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,420
at least, I want you to know where they
are not necessarily what they all do.

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,270
Here's the template.

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,650
You go to File > Template Panel > Attach,
then you have to sniff around for

18
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,140
the Rockwell Software directory
where you can find it.

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,071
I'll show you when we do the demo.

20
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:08,070
Here's what it looks like.

21
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,540
I mean, to tell you the truth,

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,607
it's usually gonna appear on your
screen as a big skinny thing.

23
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:16,992
But I expanded it, so
you could see it all in one fell swoop.

24
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:21,489
You can see a bunch of modules, the yellow
things and a bunch of spreadsheets,

25
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:22,320
lots of them.

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,758
Now I've said already and
I'll say it again,

27
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:27,017
I don't expect you to memorize all these.

28
00:01:27,017 --> 00:01:30,379
Maybe you should know where you
can find them in a pinch, but

29
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:32,678
we'll only look at a few of them for now.

30
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:37,505
So for the next couple lessons,
we might be interested in say, Seize,

31
00:01:37,505 --> 00:01:40,220
Delay, Release modules.

32
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,173
There you go, Seize, Delay, Release.

33
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:46,120
You may have heard those words before and
the Expression, Failure spreadsheets.

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,447
So there's special spreadsheets for
those guys and

35
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:52,326
you've heard those words before, as well.

36
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:54,475
Expression and failure.

37
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:55,733
Seize, Delay, Release.

38
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,280
Now, you've heard these things.

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,645
Why do we have to use separate Seize,
Delay and

40
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:04,886
Release modules when we have
those in the process module?

41
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:07,678
Seize, Delay, Release capabilities
is already in the process module.

42
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:12,654
Why are we messing around with those
things now and kind of second identities?

43
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:13,326
Well, I agree.

44
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:18,466
They're in the process module, but
it turns out that there are often

45
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:23,440
things that are too complicated to
do in the process module alone.

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,619
It can't handle certain things that
you would want a Seize and Delay and

47
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:29,650
Release to do kind of separately.

48
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,569
And remember, the basic process template
is for University of Georgia people.

49
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:37,504
And so, it's suppose to be really easy.

50
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:39,943
When you wanna do more complicated stuff,

51
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:44,223
it may be the case that you have to do
Seize, Delay and Release separately.

52
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:46,704
Possibly together, but
still separately and

53
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:49,062
we'll talk about various reasons as we go.

54
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:54,360
In particular you can handle things
like Seize, Assign, Delay, Release.

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,024
So, what if you wanted to put
something in between those blocks?

56
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:58,210
Now, you can do it.

57
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,074
You can do non-symmetric
multiple seizes and releases.

58
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:07,005
So before when you did a Seize, delay,
Release all in one fell swoop in

59
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:11,437
the process block and
you wanted to seize multiple resources,

60
00:03:11,437 --> 00:03:15,464
usually release those same
resources in the same block.

61
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:20,225
Now, you can avoid having to do stuff
like and I'll show example later.

62
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:23,548
You can also look at very
complicated seizes and

63
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:27,310
releases that might depend
on sets of servers.

64
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,286
Now we'll talk about
resource sets later on,

65
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:31,930
you're gonna see those in
the upcoming call center example.

66
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,755
But the kind of thing that I have in mind
is just not possible in a process block.

67
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:37,740
Demo time.

68
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,738
We're gonna talk about some of these
Seize, Delay, Release issues and

69
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:45,669
then I'm also gonna sneak in a little
bit of wisdom about the Expression

70
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:47,458
spreadsheet that you'll see.

71
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,165
So, we use Expressions all the time.

72
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:55,456
I'm surprised they didn't put it in
the basic process, the template.

73
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:58,701
But as long as you know where
the expression spreadsheet is,

74
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:00,874
it's in the advance process template.

75
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:01,437
There you go and

76
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:04,134
I'll talk about a couple of the things
associated with that in demo time.

77
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:08,852
The summary of what we did in this
lesson is that we talked about

78
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:11,410
the Advanced Process template.

79
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,370
This is gonna give us more and
more modules, and

80
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,590
spreadsheets to play around with.

81
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:22,996
And in the next less, in particular,
I'm gonna use the failure

82
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:28,018
spreadsheet to talk about resource
failures and maintenance.

83
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,741
So, do not fail to show up for that.

84
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:33,966
See you then.

85
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:39,200
