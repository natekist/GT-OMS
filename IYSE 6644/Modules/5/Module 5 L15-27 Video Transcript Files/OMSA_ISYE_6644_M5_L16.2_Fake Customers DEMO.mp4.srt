1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,990
In this demo, I'm gonna calculate
some normal probabilities.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,940
And the goal here is to use fake
customers, this is a demo on fake

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,910
customers, to assist me in
calculating normal probabilities

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,440
based on the successes and
failures of certain observations.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,590
So what I'll do is I'm gonna create
a fake customer once per hour.

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,440
I'm gonna do this,
what is that number, a million times.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,019
I'm gonna generate
a million fake customers.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,582
I'm gonna assign an attribute
to this fake customer.

9
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:41,819
He's gonna be a normal observation,
a normal 3 1.

10
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:47,499
And I wanna know, what's the probability
that a normal 3 1 is gonna go negative.

11
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,300
And that's all I'm gonna
do in this example.

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,162
So, I take my normal observation that
the fake customer's generating and

13
00:00:55,162 --> 00:01:00,093
to see if the normal observation
is greater than or equal to 0,

14
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,782
it's not negative.

15
00:01:01,782 --> 00:01:06,019
So, I count it as a non-negative
observation, and off it goes,

16
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:07,640
I dispose it.

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,388
On the other hand, if it is less than 0,

18
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:16,260
right the side block over here.

19
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,970
I count it as a negative observation and
off it goes into this record block.

20
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,570
And you can see that I'm counting it
in the counter, negative observation.

21
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,400
So this gets incremented by one
every time a customer goes through.

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,740
This one,
the counter is not negative observations,

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,320
that counter gets incremented by one every
time a positive observation goes through.

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,330
So I generate a normal,
if it's positive it goes up here, and

25
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,760
the counter gets incremented.

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,010
If it's negative, it goes down here,
and that counter gets incremented.

27
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,600
And then we'll look at the output for
this thing.

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,410
Now since I'm paranoid,
about these awful crystal reports thing.

29
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,730
Let's look at the reports and
I'm gonna go,

30
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,940
we're into SIMAN on this one so
that's fantastic.

31
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,862
Okay, so here we go so, let's run it.

32
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:14,230
Okay, I had it in batch mode,
the run is over let's take a look.

33
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,507
Here's a report and it turns out,
out of those 1 million observations,

34
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:26,092
998,591 were positive,
and 1,409 were negative.

35
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:29,440
And it seems to me I can
divide by 1 million.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,780
Seems to me that we've got
about a 99.86 probability.

37
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,140
That a normal 3-1 will be positive and
I can tell you that's the right answer.

38
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,020
If I went to the back of my probability
book that would be the right answer.

39
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,568
Congratulations, thank you Arena.

40
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:48,480
Okay, so now the next demo that
I'll do with fake customers

41
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,260
is I'm gonna use fake customers
to generate break downs.

42
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,720
So you'll see,
let me just run this very slowly.

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,457
Whenever you see a truck,
a truck is a fake, oops,

44
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:02,442
I got to stop the other one just a sec.

45
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:05,280
Let's go back here, stop that run.

46
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,300
Always remember to stop it.

47
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,790
So whenever you see a truck, that's a fake
customer, and he's gonna be a break down.

48
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,641
Yep, there's a break down, right
the break down's gonna occur right there.

49
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:22,120
You can see how we had a long line form.

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,170
So the truck is being,
he's in service right now.

51
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,530
That's why we had the long line before.

52
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,322
So let's do this again
a little more slowly.

53
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:34,250
We can see what happened.

54
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,520
I create regular customers
every half an hour.

55
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,346
I created a truck every ten hours,
on average.

56
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:46,310
I assign the service time
to the regular customer,

57
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,080
just plain old triangular distribution.

58
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,841
And I assign the regular
customer priority level of 2.

59
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:56,833
Keep that in mind, priority level of 2.

60
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:05,280
The truck, I have this breakdown time of
triangular, and his priority level is one.

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,120
So he's got a priority level that
the number is lower, just remember that.

62
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,725
Let's then, we go to this Process block,
seize delay release,

63
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:20,572
little, the server, the Barber serves you,

64
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:25,822
what we need to do actually is
put service time as an attribute.

65
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:34,803
Let's go here expression,
Let's write out service time.

66
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:40,762
I think that's two words.

67
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:45,395
We'll find out here in a minute So
what I've done,

68
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:49,240
service time is one word, let's go back.

69
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,302
What I've done is I've set
up the service time now,

70
00:04:54,302 --> 00:04:58,029
depending on if you're a truck or
if you're a regular person I'm gonna step

71
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:01,952
through this thing slowly, op, one last
thing, that will show you the queue.

72
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:07,039
The queue in front of the barber process
one.queue, is ranked by a lowest attribute

73
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,838
value of priority level, so if a guy with
a priority level of one comes through,

74
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:15,210
he beats out the guy with
priority level of two.

75
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,155
You'll see a truck goes to the front of
the line cause he has a higher priority

76
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:22,313
level, actually it's a lower number but
higher priority.

77
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:25,290
So, let's watch this,
I'm gonna step through.

78
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,370
First guy comes in, he's getting served.

79
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,780
You can see right there,
that 0 changed to a 1.

80
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,160
He's now being served,
a human is being served.

81
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,940
A truck comes in, the truck is in line.

82
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,713
He's gonna get served after that human
leaves another human comes through,

83
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:45,852
human is in line behind the truck.

84
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:53,660
Another human, he's in line,
yet another human.

85
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,500
That makes sense because the trucks
don't show up very often.

86
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,557
Another truck is about to show up,
watch what happens.

87
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:06,617
Okay, couple of things happened there.

88
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:10,074
The second truck actually
showed up right here,

89
00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:14,289
because the guy left in the first
truck is now in service, so

90
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,504
that truck entered went all
the way to the front of the line,

91
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:24,440
cause he's a truck, he can do that, and
the first truck is now being served.

92
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,040
So now we're gonna get a big long
line developing, unfortunately.

93
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,340
More humans show up, more lines,
cuz these trucks take a long time.

94
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,955
Now, the first truck just left,
the second one is now in service.

95
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:42,384
So there's still a big long
task ahead before these guys

96
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:44,890
can start getting served.

97
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,410
Just out of curiosity, let's see if I
can generate another truck and see what,

98
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,680
there's another truck.

99
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,840
And he goes to the front of the line,
isn't that awful?

100
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,631
So there you go, that's how the system
runs, the fake customers are trucks, and

101
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:03,923
they're essentially generating breakdowns
where these real humans can't get served.
