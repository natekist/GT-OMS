1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,910
In this demo, I'm just gonna show you how
to use failures, and we'll take a look and

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,450
see that they actually work.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,760
Failures working is kind of fun.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,240
So this is the old example
out of the Arena book,

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,140
model 3-1, and what I've done
is I've added in some failures.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,130
So this drilling center is gonna have
a failure every once in a while.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,760
So let's take a look at the resource.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,790
This resource is called drill press.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,630
It has a fixed capacity of one,
and I had a failure scheduled.

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,050
So what I did, I clicked in here,
I've got one row worth of failure,

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,890
it's called drill failure,
what a surprise, I named it that,

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,560
and the failure rule is in ignore,
doesn't matter for now.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,860
So, what did I say to do?

14
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,770
We click in there, and
then we go to advance process.

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,580
And we look at the failure spreadsheet.

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,720
There it is, right there.

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,600
And we see that I have a drill failure,
and

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,550
I've defined it as a count type failure.

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,940
So after ten customers come in,
we fail and we have a down time,

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,416
expo 30 that's nice, Expo(30).

21
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:12,830
And so the system will fail for
about 30 minutes, and

22
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,740
then come back on, we'll get 10 more
customers, and then another failure.

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,960
One thing that's interesting
is clicking into this graphic,

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,220
we'll see that something's gonna happen.

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,275
It's gonna disappear
when a failure occurs.

26
00:01:31,954 --> 00:01:34,619
Let me get out here, let's click OK.

27
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:35,761
All right, so here we go.

28
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:44,060
I think what I'll do is
I'm gonna step through so

29
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,093
you can see one customer.

30
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:53,021
Two, three,

31
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:55,986
four.

32
00:01:55,986 --> 00:02:00,825
I think we're on our fifth now,

33
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:05,134
sixth, seventh, eighth.

34
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:07,570
Ninth, and I think the tenth is coming up.

35
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,430
There's ten, and look what happened, gone.

36
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,680
So we're experiencing a failure now,
let's run it a little bit longer and

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,050
we'll see what happens.

38
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,300
Yeah, failure, failure, failure.

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,530
The queue's getting bigger,
it's just terrible.

40
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,567
Now he's back, and
the queue is building down a little bit.

41
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:25,310
A little bit, fails again.

42
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,960
So obviously we're gonna have,
now simulation's over.

43
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,397
It was a very quick one.

44
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:34,837
So you can see that the failure
really does occur and

45
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:37,530
it negatively impacts the queue.

46
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,380
Easy demo, we'll see in the next lesson.
