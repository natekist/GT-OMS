00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,060
In this lesson we're gonna be
over Crazy Re-entrant Queue

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,250
that could drive you insane,
so be careful.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,660
Here's our overview.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,940
Last time I looked at this one
line versus two lines example.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,040
In this lesson I'm going to look
at a much more interesting system,

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,400
a so-called re-entrant queue.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,740
Now, what happens here is that
you're gonna re-use servers, and

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,816
mess around with priorities, and
mess around with service times.

9
00:00:27,816 --> 00:00:32,490
So I'm re-using servers,
one customer will go from one to another,

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,700
then back to the first guy, you can
get some very non-intuitive outcomes.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,590
And you'll see in a second, so
here are re-entrant queues.

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,700
Customers go to Server 1, then
the customer will go back to Server 2,

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,450
then back to Server 1,
back to 2, back to 1.

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,877
So 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, that's sort of
re-entering, that's why we call them that.

15
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:57,961
They're depicted in Arena as
5 separate process modules

16
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:00,980
with Seize-Delay-Release trios.

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,570
And like we've done many times,

18
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,870
it's okay to seize The same server
in different process modules.

19
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,220
So, even though they look like they are in
physically different places on the screen,

20
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,656
you are still seizing the same server.

21
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:20,690
So Seize-Delay-Release five times
servers 1, 2, 1, 2, 1 in that order.

22
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:25,250
Now, this seems like a totally
perfectly boring model.

23
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,440
Let's make it interesting.

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,430
All service times are gonna be
exponential, and here are the means.

25
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,592
The first time we go to Server 1,
the mean is 0.1.

26
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:36,436
The first time we go to Server 2,
the mean is 0.5.

27
00:01:36,436 --> 00:01:41,164
Then 0.1 in server 1, then 0.1 in
server 2, then 0.1 in server 1,

28
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:43,833
these are actually chosen very carefully.

29
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,280
Here are the priorities.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,422
When the customer goes to server 1 the
first time, he actually has low priority.

31
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:54,556
So if there's another customer
going to server 1 down the line,

32
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:56,820
he's gonna have higher priority.

33
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,150
Anyway, when the customer
gets to server 2 for

34
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,630
the first time, he's got high priority.

35
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,150
Then when he goes to server 1 the second
time, he's got medium priority.

36
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,683
So see what's going on?

37
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:08,402
The service times are changing and

38
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:11,890
the priorities are changing as
they move from server to server.

39
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,070
So in other words,
on the customer's third visit to Server 1,

40
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,020
he has a high priority,
exponential 0.5 service time.

41
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,130
High priority,
that's the third visit to server 1 with

42
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,430
exponential 0.5 service time.

43
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:30,220
So it's a complicated little model, in
a sense, simple model, complicated logic.

44
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,150
Here's what it looks like.

45
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,270
Very simple, we'll see this in a minute.

46
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,311
He goes from 1, 2, 1, 2, 1.

47
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:38,970
We're gonna keep track of
how big the lines are.

48
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,029
And we're gonna keep track of
the total queue in front of Server 1.

49
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:46,438
So the total queue is gonna be
the queue here plus the queue here plus

50
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:47,560
the queue here.

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,370
So again, even though server 1 is
physically in the same place, we can

52
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,670
pretend that at least for purposes of the
screen, these are separate little lines,

53
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,500
this is the line that forms in front
of sever 1 when you're there for

54
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,478
the first time.

55
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:03,850
This is a line that forms when
you're there for the second time.

56
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,780
Maybe they're next to each other,
but they're technically treated as

57
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,310
separate lines, and here's what you
get when you add up the two lines.

58
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,240
So, it's demo time, and
we're gonna see some cool behavior.

59
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,166
Here's the summary.

60
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,480
It was just so cool, so very cool.

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,110
Words escape me, hard to believe.

62
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,472
Next time, I'm gonna get smart,
finally and literally.

63
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:30,809
So, see you in the next lesson.

64
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:37,089
