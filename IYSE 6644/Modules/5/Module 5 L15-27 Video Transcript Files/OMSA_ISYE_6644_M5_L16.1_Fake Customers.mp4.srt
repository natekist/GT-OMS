00:00:02,254 --> 00:00:04,782
This lesson has sort of
the interesting name

2
00:00:04,782 --> 00:00:08,690
of Fake Customers as we continue
our little journey through Arena.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,250
Here's our overview.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,030
In the last lesson,

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,910
I demo'd a small electronic assembly and
test manufacturing system.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,520
Very nice,
pulled together a bunch of concepts.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,490
In this lesson, I'm gonna talk about
fake customers, which we use for

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,410
a number of tricks.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,920
The idea is that these aren't
real customers at all.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,590
Their purpose is just to do some
specialized tasks that Arena might need in

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,900
certain circumstances.

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,522
Let me give a little game
plan on the next few lessons.

13
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:44,036
We're gonna cover material for a while
that will lead us to the stimulation of

14
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:46,893
a call center,
a little bit sexier simulation.

15
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:48,899
We'll talk about fake customers for now,

16
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,040
just building up some tools
to get to that call center.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,190
Then I'm gonna look at
the Advanced Process template.

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,305
We just got done with the Basic Process
template, now we're gonna become advanced.

19
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:05,480
I'll look at how we can schedule
resource failures and maintenance.

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,018
Scheduling sounds funny,

21
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:13,570
by scheduling it means we model
the random times that failures occur.

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,630
We'll then look at the Blocks Template.

23
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,634
Blocks are sort of primitive blocks
originally found in the old Simon

24
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:26,734
language, but they're very useful for
a number of different tasks.

25
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:29,210
And we're gonna start to get
a big vocabulary of these things.

26
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,180
I'm not gonna expect you
to memorize them all but

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,120
this is just another template
that you can look at.

28
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,520
Then we'll do some material on sets,
which allow us to

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,630
define things like different sets of
servers that have unique specialties.

30
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,860
So we'll talk about those in that lesson,
and

31
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,890
then I'll describe the call center,
then we'll demo the call center.

32
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,840
So with that in mind,
I'm gonna go to fake customers.

33
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,877
So you can use these fake customers
to accomplish various tasks

34
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:04,130
during a simulation.

35
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,980
Like I said, they're not actual
customers that you care about

36
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,090
in terms of waiting times or
use of resources.

37
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,120
They can use resources but
only for certain reasons.

38
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,200
And we don't care that they have to wait,
cuz they're not real, in some sense.

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,990
So, Demo Time's gonna explain it all.

40
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,960
Here's what I'll do in the demos.

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,140
I'm gonna use fake customers to
calculate normal probabilities.

42
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,810
For instance,
maybe I don't have my book available.

43
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,990
I just have Arena around.

44
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,399
And I don't have real customers,

45
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:41,960
then I use these fake customers to
somehow calculate normal probabilities.

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,850
Show you how to do that.

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,080
In the call center example, I'm gonna keep
track of which time period you're in.

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,090
So, we'll use fake
customers to do that task.

49
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,480
And we'll show it at
some point in the future.

50
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,024
And then I can also use fake
customers as a breakdown demon,

51
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:06,070
so the fake customers
will trigger breakdowns.

52
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,944
Now, in fact, in a lesson coming up
there's a direct way to trigger breakdowns

53
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:14,899
but I'll show you one thing that
you can use fake customers for.

54
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:22,365
The summary of what we did in this lesson
is that I just introduced this concept of

55
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:24,260
fake customers.

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,989
And I'm alerting you to
the fact that we're gonna be

57
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:30,535
using this occasionally several
times in upcoming applications.

58
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:32,250
So when you see the demo, you'll see this.

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,355
Next time, I'm gonna be talking about
this Advanced Process template.

60
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:42,470
Cuz we're really good
at the basic stuff now.

61
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,930
I'll show you how to get it and some of
the good stuff that you can find in it.

62
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,760
So, see you then.

63
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:54,429
