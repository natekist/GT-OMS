1
00:00:01,897 --> 00:00:05,932
In this lesson I'm gonna finally look
at sort of a non trivial two channel

2
00:00:05,932 --> 00:00:07,398
manufacturing example.

3
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:10,591
So this is a step up from some of
the earlier examples that we've been doing

4
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:11,165
with arena.

5
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:12,621
Here's our overview.

6
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:17,473
In the last lesson, I looked at
different ways to do a run control,

7
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:18,871
setup type stuff.

8
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:24,475
How to implement independent replications,
run speed, reports, that kind of thing.

9
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:28,009
In this lesson I'll put
kinda everything together.

10
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:32,810
And we'll demo a two-channel
manufacturing system where we look at

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,295
some of the concepts over the last
few lessons simultaneously.

12
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:42,885
And I want you pay particular
attention in this demo coming up,

13
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:46,479
in this lesson, how we use attributes.

14
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,253
We're gonna use attributes
to memorize things.

15
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:54,534
Here's the story, I'm plagiarizing
this model as model 4-1 from

16
00:00:54,534 --> 00:01:00,186
the Simulation with Arena book,
which you may or may not have.

17
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:01,449
I just wanna be
straightforward about this.

18
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:04,416
In this example, we have two
different types of arrival streams.

19
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,936
And we've looked at multiple
arrival streams before,

20
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,874
now I'll be a little more formal about it.

21
00:01:08,874 --> 00:01:14,096
But you have type A parts and
they show up one at a time occasionally.

22
00:01:14,096 --> 00:01:18,653
We have Type B parts, they occasionally
show up four at a time in little groups,

23
00:01:18,653 --> 00:01:19,821
in little batches.

24
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:23,591
Type A's show up a little
more often than Type B's.

25
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:27,033
So on average,
there's sort of the same number of A's and

26
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:30,490
B's in the system and
I I've got little colored marbles.

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,224
And you'll be able to tell which is which.

28
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:37,084
Type A's feed into a Prep A server,
where I guess they get prepared.

29
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:39,739
Type B's go to a Prep B server.

30
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:42,925
And they have different service
times at these preparation places.

31
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:44,363
This is a cool thing.

32
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:48,579
The parts get processed by
the same Sealer server.

33
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:52,747
I don't know what a Sealer is, whatever
it is they get processed by the same guy.

34
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:54,731
So they start out at Prep A and

35
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:58,718
Prep B respectively but
then they both go to the same guy.

36
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,317
They compete for the same resource.

37
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:04,222
What makes this interesting
is that Part A's and

38
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:09,757
Part B's have different service
time distributions at the sealer.

39
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:13,625
So the sealer is gonna have to identify
which part is he dealing with.

40
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,868
So all parts then undergo an inspection.

41
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:18,009
If they pass, they're out of there.

42
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:20,352
If they fail the inspection,
they have to get a rework.

43
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:23,471
They go to another server,
then they get another inspection and

44
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:25,908
whether or not they pass,
they're out of there.

45
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:29,719
So they get two tries hopefully they
pass on the second try at least.

46
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,906
Here's the flow chart that
I stole from the book.

47
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:36,561
Part A's come in according to
an exponential distribution with a mean of

48
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:37,565
five minutes.

49
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:42,829
Part B's, they come in every EXPO 30,
but in batches of four.

50
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:47,591
So about the same arrival rate if
you looked at them individually,

51
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:49,811
but they come in Batches of 4.

52
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:53,665
Part A's go to the preparation area,
Part A Prep.

53
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:57,246
They have a triangular distribution to
the preparation time, it's not important.

54
00:02:57,246 --> 00:03:00,253
Part B's go to the separate
preparation center.

55
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:03,471
They have a different triangular
distribution, and again, that's fine.

56
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:09,064
However both types of parts A and
B go to the Sealer, common Sealer.

57
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:12,216
And the Part As have
a triangular sealing time, and

58
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:14,562
Part B's have a wide distribution for

59
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:19,427
some other reason, but they're different
and the sealer needs to know that.

60
00:03:19,427 --> 00:03:20,418
How's he gonna know that, I don't know.

61
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:26,510
In any case, 9% of all parts coming out of
the sealer have to get reworked if they

62
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:32,707
are so unlucky as to get reworked, that's
going to take 45 minutes on average.

63
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:37,692
And then 20% of those are totally
no good and they get scrapped.

64
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:40,802
80% are okay, they're salvaged and
they ship them out.

65
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:45,787
Back over here, the 91% that
passed the original inspection

66
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:49,218
gets shipped out, happy, happy, happy.

67
00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:52,751
So the big question is how
to handle different A and

68
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,948
B service times at the Sealer?

69
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:56,181
How does the Sealer know?

70
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:58,376
I've got a couple of different
things that he can do.

71
00:03:58,376 --> 00:03:59,304
Here's is trick one.

72
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:03,532
Let's pre assign the service
times as an attribute.

73
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:06,121
We'll call the attribute Sealer Time,
what a surprise.

74
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:10,144
Then Assign module immediately
after the customer arrives.

75
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:14,096
So the first thing that happens when
the customer arrives, no time passes.

76
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:15,966
We hit them with the assign module.

77
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:20,395
And the purpose of the assign module
is to tell him what is your upcoming

78
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:21,304
Sealer Time.

79
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:25,835
And whether he's a type A or
Type B, we give him a triangular.

80
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:29,241
Or we give him a wyble,
depending on if he's Type A, Type B.

81
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:33,290
Since it's an attribute,
each customer memorizes for

82
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,485
the future what his
Sealer Time is gonna be.

83
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,223
He doesn't forget it.

84
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:41,540
When he gets to the Sealer, he tells
the Sealer, well, I got a triangular,

85
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,360
I got a wyble.

86
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:49,295
And so each customer has his own
attribute that he remembers from then on.

87
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:53,840
And so we use that attribute regardless
of whether it's a type A or type B.

88
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,930
We know what the Sealer Time is gonna be,
even though we assigned it earlier.

89
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,640
I mean heck, it's our simulation.

90
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,370
We can do the stuff,
whatever we want, right.

91
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,074
It's our simulation.

92
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:08,723
This is actually sub Trick one, but
while I'm at it I'm gonna use the assigned

93
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:14,584
module to store each customers
arrival time, also as an attribute.

94
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:18,779
Because we're interested in seeing
what the cycle times are gonna be.

95
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,174
So we need to know when does the guy show
up, and we'll store that as an attribute.

96
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:24,309
When does the guy show up?

97
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:26,274
Now how do we know when the guy shows up?

98
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:29,037
Well, when we hit the assign block,

99
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:33,774
I'll use the arena variable TNOW,
which is the current time.

100
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:38,575
And I'll assign the arrival time
attribute to the value of TNOW.

101
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:42,447
So it's perfectly okay to
assign an attribute value,

102
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:45,319
equal to arena internal variable TNOW.

103
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,506
So you assign at that point.

104
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:52,180
If you showed up at time 11.7,
he always has the arrival time for

105
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,152
that customer as 11.7.

106
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:58,542
What we'll do is we're gonna record the
departure times just before the parts get

107
00:05:58,542 --> 00:05:59,183
disposed.

108
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:01,139
We're gonna use that record block finally.

109
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,157
And this will allow us to get cycle times.

110
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:07,513
What we'll do is I'll take the departure
time and when he hits the record block

111
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:12,009
just before the dispose, minus the arrival
time, the arrival time attribute.

112
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:16,685
And what we're interested in is how long
do these guys stay in the system depending

113
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:20,548
on if they pass the first inspection,
pass the second inspection or

114
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:21,996
fail both inspections?

115
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:23,210
Let's get logical.

116
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,041
This is actually my real sudden trick.

117
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:30,084
Is there another way to model the process
time at the sealer without having

118
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:34,978
to use that assign block,
the sealer time attribute for A's and B's?

119
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,754
Well, there is.

120
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:39,704
It's a little bit of a hassle,
but I wanted to show you this.

121
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:41,096
It involves a little work.

122
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:42,009
It's nice to know.

123
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,848
This is the kind of thing
you can use later on.

124
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:46,822
Note that the entity types,
Part A and Part B,

125
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:50,426
we assign those in any case
right in the create modules.

126
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:52,218
I'll show you,
those are assigned right away.

127
00:06:52,218 --> 00:06:56,588
So instead of using the Sealer Time
as an attribute in the assign module,

128
00:06:56,588 --> 00:07:00,900
what I can do is, I won't do anything
until I get to the Sealer Process.

129
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,837
Then I'll use a logical expression.

130
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:09,638
Now logical expression reads like this,
we say that (x==y) = 1.

131
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:14,144
So what this means is does
really really equal y?

132
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:20,551
We say that this is gonna be equal
to one if in fact x does equal y.

133
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:25,901
So if I had something like (3==3),
that value (3==3

134
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:30,567
)as a logical expression is true,
and so it equals 1.

135
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:34,913
If I had (3==2), then this =0.

136
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,372
So that's why it says see why.

137
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:40,306
So I always interpret the double
equal sign meaning, they really,

138
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:41,832
really equal each other.

139
00:07:41,832 --> 00:07:44,443
Okay, so here's the logical
statement that I'll use.

140
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:46,317
When I get to the sealer,

141
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:50,886
if the entity type is a part A I
used a triangle distribution.

142
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:54,929
If it's a part B, I used the WEIB
distribution, which is what we're doing.

143
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:56,021
Now why does this work?

144
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:56,658
Well let's see.

145
00:07:56,658 --> 00:07:59,431
If entity type is part A,
this thing is equals one.

146
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:03,336
And I have one times triangular,
which is correct.

147
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:07,039
But if it's part A,
I also have this part equal to zero.

148
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,204
So if the entity type is really part A,
this logical expression = 0 so

149
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:12,839
the WEIB doesn't matter.

150
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:19,943
On the other hand, if entity type
is a part B, that = 0 and this = 1.

151
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:20,743
So I get the right answer.

152
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:23,418
Now it's cumbersome, but it works.

153
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:26,500
And I'll just show you how
that does when we do the demo.

154
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,332
So here is what the darn thing looks like.

155
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:30,628
Part A is arrive.

156
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:34,957
I do the assign of various things,
they get prepped, they get sealed,

157
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:36,917
they go through an inspection.

158
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:42,748
If they pass 91% chance, they go through
the record block and they leave.

159
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:44,934
They're shipped off very nicely,
hap, hap, happy.

160
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:49,435
If they fail the inspection,
they get reworked, another inspection,

161
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:51,666
out they go for better or for worse.

162
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,200
Part B's, same thing, they get created,

163
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,868
they get these various assignments that
we'll talk about like the sealer time.

164
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:03,552
They get prepped, go to the sealer,
inspection, out of here one way or

165
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:04,342
the other.

166
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,757
So here we go demo time, take a look and

167
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:10,319
you'll get details on what's
going on in simulation.

168
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:13,804
Here's a summary of what
we did in this lesson.

169
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:17,719
This time, we sort of looked
at our first real system.

170
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:19,896
This was a small manufacturing system.

171
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:24,322
And I tossed in a couple nice little
tricks involving attributes and

172
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:25,962
certain types of logic.

173
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:29,708
Next time,
we're gonna look at fake customers.

174
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:34,683
These are additional ways that you
can do some cool little tricks and

175
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:38,530
we'll put them in our bag so
we can use them later on.

176
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,445
So this is a very interesting concept,
and I'll see you then in the next lesson.

177
00:09:43,445 --> 00:09:51,249
