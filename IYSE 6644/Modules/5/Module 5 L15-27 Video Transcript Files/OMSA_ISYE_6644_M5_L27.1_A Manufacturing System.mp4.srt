1
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:05,364
Now I'm gonna give a description
of a manufacturing system with

2
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:07,470
an accompanying demo.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,810
This is a very nice little model that
I'm stealing from the Arena book.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,507
Here's the overview.

5
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:18,969
In the last lesson, I looked at some
very cool SMARTS and Rockwell demos.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,060
In this lesson,
I'm gonna demo a pretty easy-looking,

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,760
yet very sophisticated manufacturing cell.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,980
And I'll look at a couple of variations,
say, involving transporters and conveyors.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,330
The idea is that we can introduce
movement and multiple part paths.

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,480
Now you may not be interested in movement,

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,620
things like that,
in your particular application.

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,800
But the fact that I can do multiple
sequences of paths is very interesting and

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,350
very nice to generalize.

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,685
So we'll see how that works,
here's a description of the general model.

15
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,285
I've got a manufacturing cell
that's got 3 different types of

16
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:56,795
parts that are being produced.

17
00:00:56,795 --> 00:01:00,745
Each part follows a different path,
or what's called a sequence,

18
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:01,742
through the system.

19
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:05,892
Different service times occur to at each
station, depending on the part type and

20
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:07,832
the place in the visitation sequence.

21
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:12,613
So for instance, you could have part
type 2's visiting stations 1, 2,

22
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:14,921
4, 2, 3, in that order.

23
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:17,971
And each of those stations will
have different service times.

24
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:22,541
Even the multiple visits to station
2 might have different service times.

25
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:26,181
Movement requires
the Advanced Transfer template.

26
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:28,241
So that's another template
that you have to load.

27
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:33,154
And then you use blocks, like you use
modules like Route, Station, Enter, and

28
00:01:33,154 --> 00:01:33,668
Leave.

29
00:01:33,668 --> 00:01:35,729
You'll see those in the demo.

30
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,370
You'll also see something called
the sequences spreadsheet.

31
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,960
Which keeps track of the set of paths
that the customers can undertake.

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,700
What sequence of visitations
do they undergo?

33
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,171
And you'll need Advanced Sets
to handle sets of sequences.

34
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,991
So you can have a set of anything.

35
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:56,870
It's perfectly okay to
have a set of sequences.

36
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,000
Now there are ways to get around that.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,750
In this particular demo,
you need Advanced Sets.

38
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,380
But you can look at those if you want.

39
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,750
I won't go into detail during the demo,
itself.

40
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,261
And parts can move in a variety of ways.

41
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,350
They can just move by themselves.

42
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,260
Or I can put them on a transporter or
conveyor, lots of ways they can move.

43
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,850
If you move them on transporters or
conveyors,

44
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,020
that will require construction of
transporter and conveyor paths.

45
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,270
But that's something
that can be done easily.

46
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,390
And you'll see what they
look like in the demo.

47
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,910
This is where all the graphics take place,
and this is the code.

48
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,087
It is trivial code once
you get used to it.

49
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,240
So this right here is Route block.

50
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,871
You might have a Leave block or
an Enter block here.

51
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:42,490
These things are called stations,
sometimes.

52
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,080
So there's lots of different types
of blocks that you could use for

53
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,862
the variations of this problem.

54
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:51,900
But it's a very,
very easy problem to code up.

55
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,230
Seemingly a complicated problem,
but it's actually easy to code.

56
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,630
So here's a summary of what we just did.

57
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,510
This time, we did demos on a small yet

58
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,580
very sophisticated manufacturing cell
that really has a lot of generalizations.

59
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,670
We also looked at a couple of
variants involving movement.

60
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,720
And in fact,
this ends our module on Arena,

61
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,620
even though I don't really want it to end.

62
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,250
We're still gonna see Arena later on.

63
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,744
And in fact,
we've only scratched the surface of Arena.

64
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:21,680
There's so
many other things that we can do.

65
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:29,050
Next time, though, we're gonna start an
entire module on generating Unif(0,1)'s.

66
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,220
Very easy things, but
very, very, very important.

67
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,600
So make sure you get a little break and
come back and see those uniforms.

68
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,133
It'll be well worth it, so see then.

69
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:47,257
