00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,985
[SOUND] In this lesson we'll talk
about the blocks template which is yet

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:07,711
another template.

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:09,250
Here's our overview.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,370
In the last lesson we talked about
this concept of resource failures,

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,465
did a nice easy little demo.

6
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:20,915
And this lesson my objective is
to add to our ever growing bag

7
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:24,564
of tricks by introducing
this blocks template.

8
00:00:24,564 --> 00:00:26,493
And there are tons and
tons of these things,

9
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,640
these blocks that you'll
see in a little while.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,162
I don't want you to be intimidated.

11
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:33,631
We'll use a few as examples.

12
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,913
Here is what the template looks like.

13
00:00:35,913 --> 00:00:39,147
Woah, there are lots of blocks.

14
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:44,313
You can get them from file template
panel attach, sniff around, find it.

15
00:00:44,313 --> 00:00:45,601
Huge number.

16
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:49,408
Don't be scared!d I'm not gonna
have you memorize all these things,

17
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,555
it's not possible.

18
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:52,066
If you can look at the names and

19
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:55,707
kind of put them in the back of your
mind in case you need these sometime.

20
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:59,511
But they're sort of
a self-contained language,

21
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:03,990
related to the old version
of Arena called SIMAN.

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,542
And they're very specialized in low level,
you use them occasionally.

23
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:12,705
And they have the ability to be powerful,
but

24
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,876
we won't be concentrating
on them too much.

25
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,895
But we'll use them here and
there in specialized situations.

26
00:01:18,895 --> 00:01:22,584
They are very nice but
we only use a few for right now.

27
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:26,903
Seize, Delay, Release,
Queue and Alter just for

28
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:30,330
now, one, two, three, four, five.

29
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,281
So you may have seen again
some of these words.

30
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:34,454
What?

31
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:41,980
Well we're seeing Seize, Delay,
Release yet again and why is that?

32
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,912
Why do we constantly see these
things all over the place?

33
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:47,111
Well, the main reason,

34
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:52,785
at least in my opinion Arenas
are built in layers over the years.

35
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:57,930
When they make an improvement,
they add a new template and

36
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,980
sometimes they like stuff so
much it gets repeated.

37
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,740
And so Seize, Delay, Release have
found their way all the way from

38
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,022
the original version SIMAN into Arena and
they appear in several places.

39
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:17,848
On the other hand for whatever reason
some of these primitive blocks such as

40
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:22,077
the queue block which we're gonna
see in our first demo example.

41
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:26,879
You can can't even connect to a Seize
block with a Queue block form the advanced

42
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,620
process template or in a process module
from the basic process template.

43
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,041
If you wanna use a queue block for
whatever reason, you're stuck.

44
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:40,293
You have to use one of these
primitive seize blocks.

45
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:43,381
So for that reason alone it's
good to learn these things.

46
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:47,683
Anyway let's do Demo Time,
I'm gonna show you a couple things.

47
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:52,752
We'll do a Queue-Seize-Delay-Release
example using only primitive blocks.

48
00:02:52,752 --> 00:02:55,996
And the reason I'm showing you this
thing is that we're gonna see it again

49
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:57,682
in the call center example coming up.

50
00:02:57,682 --> 00:03:00,213
So I'm gonna blow though
this fairly quickly,

51
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:04,530
not gonna go into tons of details, so I'm
just gonna show you what it looks like.

52
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,620
And then I'll look at a cute little
example using an Alter block to change

53
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,169
the number of resources
that are available,

54
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:13,600
the number of servers that are available.

55
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,142
As the queue gets bigger and
bigger, we might wanna

56
00:03:18,142 --> 00:03:22,621
bring in some more people to help us,
and so we use the Alter block for that.

57
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:26,353
So go take a look at a demo,
then nice one.

58
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:28,262
As for today's summary,

59
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:32,962
this time we'll look to that
black template, lot's of stuff.

60
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:37,012
And later on we're gonna find
some uses for these guys.

61
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:40,487
Next time we'll look into
what are called sets,

62
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,806
they are resource sets,
other types of sets.

63
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:48,384
And I wanna show you how these
sets make modeling lots easier in

64
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:50,331
certain circumstances.

65
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:53,731
They are really quite intuitive and
they are easy to implement.

66
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:56,201
So we'll see you next time.

67
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,473
