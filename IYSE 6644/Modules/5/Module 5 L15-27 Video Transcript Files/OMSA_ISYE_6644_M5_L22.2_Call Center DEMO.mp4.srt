1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,433
Well, now the call center demo.

2
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:05,153
Finally gonna do this after all this time.

3
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:07,804
Here's the main screen for
the call center,

4
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:10,610
you can see it is arranged in submodels.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,280
Here is where we get the submodel from.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,010
Click on here, submodel, then you click
inside of it if you wanna start editing.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,560
So I've already done that,
we have got the submodels here.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,080
Time period counter,
create arrivals, tech support,

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,028
sales calls, order status calls,
return tech support calls.

10
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:28,160
Notice how they're connected up except for

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,800
this time period counter which
is an island all by itself.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,520
No man is an island, but submodels are.

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,607
So let's click into this, we'll do this
first or by the way, see how it runs.

14
00:00:38,992 --> 00:00:42,961
Okay, looks a little boring but
regenerating arrivals and they go through

15
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:47,810
some tech support, some sales,
some order status, some return calls.

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,446
What's going on in
the time period counter,

17
00:00:51,446 --> 00:00:56,722
it's only job is to use fake
costumers to update the time period.

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:05,840
It turns out every 11 hours,
one of these fake customers is generated.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,790
Every half hour, they go around
the circle, and they update the period.

20
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,830
The period is useful for
certain statistics gathering, and for

21
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,720
keeping track of when your
arrival rate changes,

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,890
when the resources, the servers
go on breaks, things like that.

23
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,500
So you can see when I get to 22,
it's gonna kill this off.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,565
Watch what happens here,18, 19, 20, 21.

25
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:34,636
Here we go, 11 hours, 22.

26
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,920
And off it goes, and
a new one's generated.

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,613
Now, this clock here says,
it doesn't go to 6 PM,

28
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:42,143
because we're starting
it sort of at midnight.

29
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,877
And you have to pretend that midnight
corresponds to eight in the morning when

30
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:48,810
the simulation when the call
center actually opens.

31
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,060
Okay, it just goes round and
round generating,

32
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,270
this fake customers keep in track
of the variable called period.

33
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,390
So period is a variable that
keeps updated every half hour.

34
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,640
Okay, that's all I have to say there.

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,980
Now I'll go to the navigate bar.

36
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,980
I go back to Top Level, and
then let's go to create and direct.

37
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,230
We've seen this stuff before.

38
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,020
I did an entire demo on these blocks,
customers are created.

39
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,610
I'm just gonna run through here.

40
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,950
Let's run a little more slowly.

41
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:22,450
That doesn't appear to
be that much slower.

42
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,992
Customers are created,
they go through a queue of capacity 0.

43
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:28,456
We'll talk about that in a second.

44
00:02:28,456 --> 00:02:32,699
They attempt to seize a trunk line,
there are 26 trunk lines.

45
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:36,598
This queue has capacity 0.

46
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:38,750
See the 0 there?

47
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,970
So that means,
if it can get in the seize block,

48
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,550
it's forced to stay over here at the queue
block, but queue block has capacity 0.

49
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,904
So it's kicked out over here.

50
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:52,149
It goes through a couple statistics
gathering things, don't worry about those,

51
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:53,640
and is disposed.

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,880
If it can seize the guy,
one of the trunk lines,

53
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,211
we assign an arrival time,
it listens to music.

54
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:05,739
And then we determine the call type,
that's what this endway by choice is,

55
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:06,739
let's take a look.

56
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:11,702
Endway by chance, I always say choice,
endway by chance.

57
00:03:11,702 --> 00:03:18,384
76% goes off to product type one,
76% goes to call center.

58
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:21,590
Tech support, 16% goes to sales and

59
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,000
the remaining 8% goes to order status,
that's the purpose of this.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,600
Then, it looks like we exit the submodel.

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,190
These things are provided automatically.

62
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,390
So we exit the submodel,
go back to navigate.

63
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:43,150
Top level and see, one, two, three.

64
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,520
Tech support, sales, order status.

65
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,622
Let's do sales right now,
it's the easiest thing.

66
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:57,170
Very simple, seize the sales guy, delay
him for awhile, Release the sales guy.

67
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,300
Now in fact, you're done.

68
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,710
So you have to release the sales guy, and
don't forget to release the trunk line.

69
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,154
So this is a delayed release of
the trunk line that you originally

70
00:04:09,154 --> 00:04:14,243
seized back in the submodel,
where we created the arrivals.

71
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:18,220
Okay, so this is a good point now
to take a look at some resources.

72
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,440
Basic process, resource spreadsheet.

73
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,761
Let's look at these resources.

74
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:26,718
A lot of resources,
holy smokes, Charity, Noah,

75
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:29,130
Molly, these are all
the tech support guys.

76
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,530
We'll look at them in a minute.

77
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,300
They all have schedules, and

78
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,620
then the sales force,
it turns out they have a schedule.

79
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,770
There's seven of them but they have
schedules cuz they can go on lunches but

80
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,040
they're all vanilla and
faceless and the same.

81
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
They do have a schedule, though.

82
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,780
And then the trunk line is a fixed
capacity of 26 phone lines.

83
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,582
So we'll look at these schedules, Charity,
Noah, Molly, blah, blahm blah in a minute.

84
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:56,644
Schedules, there we go.

85
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,510
Here's Charity's schedule, click.

86
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,510
And, so she's working,
this is eight in the morning.

87
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,224
This looks like one, two, three,
three and a half hours, so this is 11:30.

88
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:13,126
She works for three and a half hours,
lunch break, works some more, goes home.

89
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:15,674
So that's charity.

90
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:17,657
Not gonna save her schedule.

91
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:18,672
Let's look at Noah.

92
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:20,024
Yeah, he works later in the day, so

93
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:22,110
see everyone one of them has
got a different schedule.

94
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,090
We don't need that noise.

95
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,730
Then we can look at the sales schedule.

96
00:05:31,838 --> 00:05:34,189
These are the faceless sales team.

97
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:38,242
We start out with three in the morning,
goes up to seven.

98
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:41,420
They take some lunches
a couple of them sequentially.

99
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,060
Goes back up to 7 and
then there's 5 by time 11.

100
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,642
So that corresponds to 6, that's 11, so

101
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:54,718
yeah, that corresponds
to 7 PM when they leave.

102
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:56,720
Okay, and
these are in half hour increments.

103
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:05,240
Sometimes, it doesn't make sense to click
on these because you wanna get more fine

104
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,530
tuning, but when you have these discrete
integer increments, this is just fine.

105
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,950
I'll show you how to do this without
clicking on these in a second,

106
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,640
when we look at the arrival schedule.

107
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,420
So notice,
this is an arrival type schedule, so

108
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,400
in the type you have to click arrival.

109
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,040
Let's take a look at this.

110
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,530
Much more complicated looking, but
what this is, see we have about,

111
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,835
this number is,
you could look under the OK.

112
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,860
This is 20 arrivals per hour,
35, you can see it goes up, and

113
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,800
then down as the day progresses.

114
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,000
These last two zeros correspond to
the period between 6 and 7 o'clock

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,900
when there's still a couple staff members
around but we cut off the arrivals.

116
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,300
So these remaining customers filter
through the system at this point.

117
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,790
It's perfectly okay to click these numbers
in, but what some people like to do.

118
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,200
I'm gonna say no,
I'm not gonna save the changes.

119
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,540
You can right-click, right-click and
edit via a spreadsheet.

120
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,670
This is what I usually do if
I have a complicated one.

121
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,920
And let's do this.

122
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,590
See, here we've just
typed these in by hand.

123
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,390
Notice that when it says duration here,
this means,

124
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:19,640
we have a rate of 75 customers
per hour for two time periods.

125
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,704
This is two half hour time periods,
this means,

126
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:26,153
70 customers per hour for
one half hour time period.

127
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:30,214
Remember, this time periods are always,

128
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:36,820
What we define, but the 70 and
75 are always per hour.

129
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,190
So we define the time periods
as one-half hour time periods.

130
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,110
But the arrival rates
are always in per hour units.

131
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,184
A little confusing, but
you just have to get used to it.

132
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:51,138
So when we see this 75 for
two half hour time periods, what this is,

133
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,790
let's take a look at it again.

134
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,190
See, when we have, let's see,
where does that happen?

135
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,190
Right there, see, two time periods
in a row, 75 and what they're doing,

136
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,100
they're saving space in
that little spreadsheet.

137
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,310
It's a little stupid but
that's what they do.

138
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,040
Okay, so that's easy.

139
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,748
And this gives me
the various arrival rates.

140
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:15,994
Okay, now the last thing I'll look at
are the resource sets, And here they are.

141
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:19,850
We have these resource sets,
ignore these guys like I said before.

142
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,478
Product 1, there's Charity, Noah, Maui,
Anna, and Sammy, in preferred order.

143
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:31,882
Product 2, Tierney, Shawn,
Emma, Anna, and Sammy,

144
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:37,380
again in preferred order, so you can see
the cross functionality Anna and Sammy.

145
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,150
Let's go to Navigate, Top level.

146
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:45,650
And I am now gonna cruise right into
the tech support module right here,

147
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,940
so I can do that there.

148
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,290
And that's what it looks like.

149
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,254
What a mess, but it's actually quite easy.

150
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:56,434
So I'm zooming in, and
let's run the model.

151
00:08:58,325 --> 00:09:01,192
See they come in,
they randomly choose one, two,

152
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:04,500
or three of these, are the product types.

153
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,280
They do a certain assignment, this is
when they actually start getting served.

154
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,032
So seize, when did we start
getting served, seize the server,

155
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:17,904
when they start getting served,
delay for a while,

156
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:21,688
release the server, and
the phone line and leave.

157
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:24,167
Now, there's a possibility of a call back,
we'll get into that in a second.

158
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:28,950
Okay, and so let's watch this.

159
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,720
We're gonna seize product 1,
assign the arrival time, delay

160
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,450
product one servers, and then release
product one server in the phone line.

161
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,435
So let's do a deeper dive there.

162
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:43,360
This, of course, is just the probability
of going to product 1, 2, or, 3.

163
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,440
So seize as I promised,

164
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,090
seize one server from the set of
product one guys, in preferred order.

165
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,790
Store that guy's name, the person
that you seized and tech agent index.

166
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:00,030
Let's assign the product type as one,
we'll use that later on.

167
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,552
The call starts at time T now.

168
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:12,260
Delay the guy for an expression called
tech time that's defined over here.

169
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,490
Let's see, I think it's an expression,
so we go into advanced process.

170
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,290
Yep, there it is, expression,
tech time, triangular 3, 6, 18.

171
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,932
The reason that we put as
an expression instead of just typing,

172
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:29,884
Triangular or whatever was here,

173
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:34,373
is because we use the same tech time
in three places and we wanna be lazy.

174
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:37,712
And not have to type triangular blah,
blah, blah in three places,

175
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:39,530
especially if we change it.

176
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,857
Okay, then when you're
done getting served,

177
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:46,540
release one guy from
the set called product 1.

178
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,750
Make sure it's the specific
number that you've used and

179
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,840
that specific number is
stored in tech agent index.

180
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,330
Okay, so be careful about that.

181
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,940
And then, of course, release the phone
line, so somebody else can use it.

182
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,960
A very simple, okay?

183
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,820
So then, let's go back to the top.

184
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,644
Navigate and
here's what we're looking at, whoops.

185
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:12,951
We just got done with tech support.

186
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:17,790
By the way, I can move it around like this
too, but that I always screw this up.

187
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,530
So we just got done with tech support, and

188
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,100
you'll notice that all these customers
are routed into return tech call.

189
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,298
See they're all going
to return tech calls.

190
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:34,010
Now only 4% of the customers actually
get a return tech support call.

191
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,310
Zoom in, and so

192
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,430
that means, that 96% of them are not
effected that happens right here.

193
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,961
Let's watch.

194
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:44,970
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, see,
almost everybody's going here.

195
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,591
What happens is that they
are immediately disposed.

196
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:54,989
So only 4% actually go to return tech
support, all the way through here.

197
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:59,920
96% of them are disposed, you can watch.

198
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,430
I see every once in a while, you'll
actually get one that's, there we go,

199
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,920
we finally got one, and
they go to the product type 1, 2, or 3.

200
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,180
I'm gonna just click in on these now and
go through this fairly quickly.

201
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,584
Remember, we set as an attribute in tech

202
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:19,630
support submodel,
what kind of product type you were?

203
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,095
So we do N-way by Condition,
which product type you are,

204
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:27,380
if you're product type 1, 2,
or 3, that's where you go.

205
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,024
This is a seize, delay, release again.

206
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:35,479
Let's see, so you have to seize
a phone line, seize trunk line,

207
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:39,405
because the guy's calling
you back with high priority.

208
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:42,926
So, the sales guy's actually
calling you back, but

209
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:47,084
it's equivalent to you calling
them back with high priority.

210
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:49,650
And not having to go through
that queue block, so

211
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,786
you get the first available trunk line.

212
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:53,210
So he sees that.

213
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,930
You also,

214
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,910
you don't actually seize that until your
able to seize your tech support guy first.

215
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,190
So you do this one,
then you get the phone line.

216
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:09,550
So seize one guy from product one, the
specific member that you talked to before,

217
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,180
not preferred order anymore, it's
the specific guy you talked to before.

218
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,450
Because you remembered who he was,
tech agent index.

219
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,380
You use them for a while,
return call time,

220
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,880
which is return tech time,
it's another expression.

221
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,850
And then you release that guy,
using the same command as before,

222
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,400
release one guy from product 1 sets,
specific member,

223
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,270
tech agent index, and then,
release the phone line.

224
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,210
You're done.

225
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,673
So there's one thing I forgot to show,
and I'll just do that in two seconds,

226
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:40,539
cuz it's so easy.

227
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:46,384
Order status, and
basically what that is, let's watch it.

228
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:50,739
You go through a little delay from
the order status, you're asking, well,

229
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:52,090
how's my order doing?

230
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,480
You do that by yourself.

231
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,390
And then,
some small number require a sales guy.

232
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,210
So all this is doing,
this looks real sloppy.

233
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,724
All this is doing is it's
just seizing a sales guy.

234
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:06,861
And then either way, either if you go
through the sales guy or you don't,

235
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:10,120
you end up right here and
you release the phone line.

236
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,980
So very, very simple, and that's it.

237
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,790
So what I encourage you to do,

238
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,960
is you may need to look at
this demo a couple of times.

239
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,960
There's a lot of stuff going on here, and
I went through things fairly quickly, but

240
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,750
look at the demo a couple of times.

241
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,600
Once you understand everything,
you are consultants, congratulations.

242
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,550
You've just done a very,
very difficult model, and

243
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,100
you're ready to go make
a lot of money now.

244
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,782
Here's a summary of what we did.

245
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:39,427
This time, I put together everything, and

246
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:43,093
we finally demoed the Call Center
example in its radiant glory.

247
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:50,468
In the next lesson,
what I'll do is describe in plain English,

248
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:53,780
an inventory system, and
then do a demo there.

249
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,080
We'll be doing a bunch of these
specialty demos from now on.

250
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,447
So see you then, can't wait.

251
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:08,629
