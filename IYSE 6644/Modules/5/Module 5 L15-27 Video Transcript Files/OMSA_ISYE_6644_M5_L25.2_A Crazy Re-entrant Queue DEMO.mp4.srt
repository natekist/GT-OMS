1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,560
Here's our demo on re-entrant queues,
very cool.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,840
I'm gonna show you what's going on,
and then we'll run it.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,540
So create customers every once in a while,
they go to server 1, server 2,

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,580
server 1, server 2,
server 1, in that order.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,420
So I'm literally, I was very non-original,
seize delay release, server 1, how boring.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,660
Exponential 0.1 service times.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,512
You can refer to the lessons,
to the lesson,

8
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:28,450
to see what the server
times were in each case.

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,970
They're exponential, like 0.1, 0.5,
but you can look at the order.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,490
The only thing that's a little
different is the priority.

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,140
And in each case, the first time I
see server 1, it's low priority.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,279
First time I see server 2,
it's high priority.

13
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:46,650
Second time, I see server 1,
medium priority.

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,520
So that's where I'm getting those.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,280
I'm keeping track of
individual queue sizes,

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,090
I'm keeping track of overall queue sizes.

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,125
Here we go,
this is a very fast demo, ready?

18
00:00:58,602 --> 00:00:59,770
This is scary, here we go.

19
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:06,610
Now you can see, boring, boring,
boring, some queues are forming here.

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,570
You can see the numbers.

21
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,080
And it looks like server 1,
server 2, they've got some queues.

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,940
The queues look a little bigger now.

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,354
Server 2's all of a sudden
got some big queues.

24
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:22,720
Now server 1 seems to be
getting some big queues.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,410
That's interesting.

26
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,270
Now looks like it's gone back to server 2,
and what's going on?

27
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,280
Now let's look down here.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,800
You don't have to look at the picture,
just look at the numbers.

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,910
We're are getting bizarre, oscillating
queue behavior between server 1 and

30
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,794
server 2.

31
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,390
One goes up, they clear up,
the other one comes down.

32
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,580
This is the result of the careful
selection of the priorities and

33
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,740
the service times.

34
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,970
And we're gonna get oscillating behavior,
and

35
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,880
not only is it oscillating behavior,
it gets worse and worse.

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,128
Let me run it faster and we'll see.

37
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:06,474
So this number peaked out at 40,
60, let's see what this time.

38
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:10,820
It will get worse and worse.

39
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:16,218
75 this time.

40
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:20,880
So what's happening is you're getting this
crazy oscillating behavior because of

41
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,780
the way that we chose the priorities and
the service times, etc.

42
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,294
etc.
It actually died down a little bit here.

43
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:32,894
If you let this thing run and
run, it gets worse and worse, and

44
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:37,327
this is extremely interesting behavior,
which you can play around with and

45
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:39,200
show and amaze your friends.

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,200
So that's a quick demo, take a look at
it and we'll see you in the next lesson.
