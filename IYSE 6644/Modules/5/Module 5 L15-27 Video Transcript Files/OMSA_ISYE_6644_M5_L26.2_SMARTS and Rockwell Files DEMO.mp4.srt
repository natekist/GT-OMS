1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,340
What we'll be doing here, is we'll look
at an arrival rate that varies via

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,760
an expression, and actually a variable
that depends on the day of the week.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:16,072
So here we have, I'm gonna create
some customers, and the arrival

4
00:00:16,072 --> 00:00:21,690
rate is gonna depend on this expression.

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:28,230
One per day of week, and this day of
week rate is defined as a variable.

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,410
So let's take a look at that.

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,460
Day rate of day.

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,680
So Tuesdays are different than Wednesdays,
let's say.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,210
So we go into basic process,
variable and look at this.

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,830
We have day, which can be,
that's just the day of the week.

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,810
We'll start out at 1.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,430
Day rate 7 rows corresponding
to different rates per day.

13
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,388
How do we know what day it is?

14
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:54,780
Well, very simple.

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,150
We use this fake observation right
here to generate the days of the week.

16
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,020
Let's just watch.

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,850
It goes round and
round every once in a while.

18
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:05,700
Watch this.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,180
See?
Customer comes around, 2.

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,970
He's gonna come around again, 3.

21
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,350
So, once a day this updates,
and this is kind of smart.

22
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,640
It goes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,400
Then it's smart enough to come back to 1.

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,830
You can take a look at that.

25
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,650
And here, the rate just changes by looking

26
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,850
up what value in
the variable vector to take.

27
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,210
Does it take the first, second, third,
fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh.

28
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,710
So very, very simple and

29
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:38,120
this is just one little tutorial that
a reading gives you in the smarts file.

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,710
Another thing that Rockwell
is very good about,

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,080
is that it has a lot of cool little demos.

32
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,760
I'll show you one, for instance.

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,630
Let's look at a emergency room.

34
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,080
And this is a professionally
prepared demo from Rockwell.

35
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,420
You'll see mostly the graphics and
not the underlying logic to the thing,

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,405
but here are the graphics.

37
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:58,737
Let's watch.

38
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:02,380
It's beautiful.

39
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,010
If I make this a little bit fuller screen.

40
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:11,100
Quite nice, so you can see customers
coming in, the clock changes.

41
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,240
It's quite nice.

42
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:20,806
And this is prepared by Rockwell, and

43
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:24,630
they have numerous demos
that you can show people.

44
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,360
Very nice.
They come into the emergency room,

45
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,650
get served, there's a waiting area.

46
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,710
It's quite nice and it keeps track of
ongoing conditions in neutralization, and

47
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,810
things like that.

48
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,440
So, there you go.
