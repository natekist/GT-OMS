1
00:00:02,141 --> 00:00:06,251
In this lesson we'll be looking at
how to generate resource failures in

2
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:10,740
order to conduct maintenance, or
just failures in and of themselves.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,325
Arena is very good at this and
very simple to do this task.

4
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:16,870
Here's what we'll do.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,470
Last lesson we learned about
the Advanced Process template and

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,420
all the cool stuff that's there,
a treasure chest of stuff.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,290
In this lesson, I'm gonna study model
breakdowns and maintenance in a way that's

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,020
way more direct than these fake customer
things that we used in the last demo.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,790
And the idea here is that we'll just be
looking at a certain type of schedule,

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,099
a failure schedule.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,040
You can cause resource failures
by scheduling breakdown demons,

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,420
like we did before, but
it just ain't elegant.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,860
It's perfectly okay, and if you're on
a desert island, that's what you can do.

14
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,530
A better way is to use the Resource and

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,340
Failure spreadsheets in
conjunction with each other.

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,100
A very simple way to do this,
it takes just less than a minute.

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,890
So here's the Resource spreadsheet
on the bottom of the screen.

18
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,570
You'll see in the last column
there's a Failures tab.

19
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,840
I've clicked on one row,

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,070
which is gonna correspond to a failure
that we'll call Drill Failure.

21
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,087
But we'll give the recipe for
all this in a minute.

22
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:24,227
So, the failure name's gonna
be called Drill Failure.

23
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:27,862
Then, if I happen to go over
to the Failure spreadsheet,

24
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:30,666
which is in the Advanced Process template,

25
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:35,209
I'm gonna see Drill Failure is all there,
waiting for me to use it, and

26
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:38,970
it's this thing called a comp
failure with a count of ten.

27
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,221
I'll just give it away, what that means
is we're gonna have a failure after ten

28
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:45,010
people have used the drill.

29
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,690
So, this could be like maintenance.

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,860
You purposely take the drill down
after ten customers are there,

31
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,990
then you work on it for
exponential 30 downtime.

32
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,960
Let's look at the recipe here.

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,010
We go to the Resource spreadsheet
in the Basic Process template.

34
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,670
Click on the Failures column.

35
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,900
Add a Failure Name,
Drill Failure for instance.

36
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,250
Choose the Failure Rule,
which we'll talk about in a minute.

37
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,580
So right now,
the Failure Rule says ignore.

38
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,130
Let's ignore that for a second.

39
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,220
Then, go the Failure Spreadsheet.

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,480
You will see the failure name
that you just chose waiting for

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,850
you, all happy and ready to go.

42
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,600
That's in the Advanced Process template.

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,836
Choose the type of failure, so
it could be a count failure.

44
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:32,240
Remember, after ten arrivals, ten uses
of the machine, we have a failure.

45
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,870
Or it could be a time failure, so after a
random amount of time you have a failure.

46
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,520
Both are perfectly reasonable.

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,320
Then choose a downtime for
repair, could be any expression.

48
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,830
We had exponential on the last page.

49
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,880
Couple remarks.

50
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,170
You can schedule multiple failures by
clicking on multiple rows of the Failures

51
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,710
column in the Resource spreadsheet.

52
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,180
So we just had drill failure, but
we could also click on rows and

53
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,490
we could have a type I failure,
type II failure, scheduled maintenance.

54
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,008
We could make all sorts of failures by
clicking on more and more rows, and

55
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:03,850
they get scheduled separately.

56
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,503
Now, remember how I told
you to ignore the ignore?

57
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:09,430
Well, these are different
types of Failure Rules.

58
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,880
Ignore means it's not a killer failure,
in the sense that the failure happens, but

59
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,475
you get to complete service of a current
customer if there's one in the system.

60
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:24,000
So if you're working on somebody and
you fail, It's not a terrible thing.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,940
You get to keep on working at the guy.

62
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,060
But then, you reduce the repair time.

63
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,730
So in other words, if my repair time is
supposed to be an hour and the failure

64
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,550
occurs and my customer still needs 10
more minutes, I complete working on him.

65
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,910
So I work on him for 10 more minutes and
the repair time goes down to 50 minutes.

66
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,910
It still finishes at the 60 minute or
one hour mark.

67
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,060
So, the ignore means I
reduce my repair time.

68
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,910
On the other hand, a wait means well, I
still complete the service of the current

69
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,980
customer, but I delay the full repair.

70
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,600
So again, if the repair time is an hour
and my current customer needs 10 minutes,

71
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,225
then the repair finishes at the 10
plus 60 equals 70 minute mark, so

72
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:10,150
I've waited to finish the repair.

73
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,570
The worst thing is preempt.

74
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:16,280
When the failure occurs, I immediately
stop service of the current customer, but

75
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,600
I complete it after the repair is done.

76
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,750
So, I got a guy in service.

77
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,930
He needs 10 more minutes, but
the failure occurs, breakdown occurs.

78
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,060
So my current customer
stops getting served,

79
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,360
I complete the repair after 60 minutes,
and

80
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,430
then I remember I've got 10 more minutes
to work on the finish of that customer.

81
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,480
So he's outta there after 70 minutes.

82
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,190
So all of these are kinda nice and
very easy to use, obviously.

83
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,720
Here's our summary.

84
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,260
How ironic,

85
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,870
we have literally succeeded in learning
how to implement failures, and it's crazy.

86
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,820
And speaking of crazy,

87
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,130
I'm gonna give a quick intro next time
to the so-called Blocks template.

88
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,120
It just gives us unbelievable
crazy number of things to look at.

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,800
But I'll try to be real gentle about it,
cuz we'll only use a few of them for now.

90
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,768
So, really looking forward
to talking about Blocks.

91
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:20,210
See you a little later.
