1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,720
In this demo, I'm gonna show you
the use of certain primitive blocks.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,876
In particular the queue block,
the seize block, and the delay block.

3
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,342
So let me show you here.

4
00:00:10,342 --> 00:00:14,242
Blocks, I previously loaded that template,
and I go around, I look,

5
00:00:14,242 --> 00:00:18,662
they're in alphabetical order, so if I
want a delay block, bang, there it is,

6
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:19,970
I can just drag it over.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,549
I don't want it, so let me Delete it.

8
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:27,210
And we're gonna be seeing pretty much
the same example again when we do

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,896
the call center example later on, and so

10
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:35,960
I'm not gonna go into huge detail here
other than to say, I create some arrivals.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,131
I'm gonna try to seize this resource.

12
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:41,155
The resource is called Trunk Line.

13
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:44,385
It's just the number of
telephone lines that I have.

14
00:00:44,385 --> 00:00:49,901
And if I remember correctly,
let's go to Basic Process > Resource,

15
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:53,370
I have a Trunk Line that
has a Capacity of 3.

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,541
So I have three Trunk Lines, in other
words, three phone lines are available.

17
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:01,270
I'm willing to put up with
a queue of size 4, so

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,790
this is where the queue is defined,
trunkline.queue.

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,579
So if I go over here,
this is a first in first out queue and

20
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,040
the Capacity of this queue is 4.

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,790
If I use a queue block, which is
the main reason I use a queue block.

22
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,486
If I exceed the capacity of
the queue I automatically kill

23
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:25,798
off the customers by sending
them to this dispose.

24
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:28,770
So that's what is nice about the queue
block, that's why people use it.

25
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,702
If the queue block is overcapacitated,
out you go.

26
00:01:31,702 --> 00:01:35,552
So the only way I can use a seize block
with this particular queue block is that

27
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:37,789
I've got to use the primitive seize block.

28
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,637
That's why I'm not using the yellow
one from the advanced process or

29
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:45,899
the process version of the seize, so
I'm stuck with this primitive seize.

30
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,860
And then I'm stuck with a primitive delay.

31
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,794
So I just want to show you what's
going on here, this is not a big deal,

32
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:55,146
cuz we'll be seeing this again later on.

33
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:58,338
These numbers here represent
the number of people in the queue, and

34
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:00,360
the number of servers being used.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,065
One thing being queued here is
that I have a three way by chance.

36
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:10,525
And so the customers will go to
the first choice with probability 76,

37
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:16,167
just like the number of trombones in
the big parade, with probably 16%

38
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:21,820
to the second choice and was remaining
probably 8% to the third choice.

39
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,901
So let's watch,
I'm gonna step through this, here we go.

40
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:28,460
Click, first customer shows up.

41
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,453
There's nobody in the queue right now,
so he goes through,

42
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:33,400
there's nobody seized at this point.

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,491
One server is now being used.

44
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:39,440
Second guy shows up,
two servers are being used.

45
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,586
Third guy shows up,
three servers are being used.

46
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:47,102
Fourth guy shows up,
one person in the line.

47
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:49,273
See how that works?

48
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:53,732
We also had somebody leave and so
that fourth guy is now being served.

49
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:55,010
So you can see how this works.

50
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,056
It's very nice.

51
00:02:56,056 --> 00:03:02,700
Let's run this sorta slowly and we'll
see how the queue builds up and down.

52
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,693
There we go, see, we had a queue
of four so a guy had to leave.

53
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,218
We will see that again.

54
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:12,390
See, when the queue gets to be four,
customers have to leave.

55
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,176
Isn't that nice?

56
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:15,958
Very, very easy example.

57
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,444
And you can see how the blocks work so
nicely.

58
00:03:18,444 --> 00:03:22,570
Like I said, we'll be going into
much more detail on that later on.

59
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,346
Okay so let me now do a very cute
little example that I worked up.

60
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:30,179
This is using an alter block.

61
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:32,556
This is the block, this is alter.

62
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:34,235
Now where is he?

63
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:39,271
In alphabetical order, I drag this guy
over, alter, and what the alter block

64
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:44,860
does, he's responsible for adding servers
to a resource, or subtracting servers.

65
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,805
So let's look at this one.

66
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:49,290
It says Barber 1.

67
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,024
What that is doing is if you
pass a customer through here,

68
00:03:55,024 --> 00:04:02,317
or a fake customer, the number of
servers in the barber increases by 1.

69
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:06,414
And f I wanted to,
I could put a 2 here or a negative 1.

70
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:09,828
I could change the number of
servers by anything I want, but

71
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:13,660
alter is used to change the number
of servers that are resource.

72
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,420
Sometimes I say number of resources, but

73
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,845
I really mean number of servers that
are resource, number of parallel servers.

74
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:19,828
So let's watch.

75
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:24,273
Here's the Create block,
this Decide block is just saying,

76
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:30,011
if the number of people in the queue is
greater than or equal to 3, add a server.

77
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,392
And we can keep track of the number
of people in the queue and

78
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:36,100
the number of resources being used.

79
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,990
Let me actually just see how
many people are in this barber.

80
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,669
So we currently have, in the barber,
I'm going to look at the number resources.

81
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:49,750
So the barber has a capacity of 1.

82
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,484
There's a Trunk Line which
we're not using anymore so

83
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:55,047
you can ignore that,
in fact I'll just Delete it.

84
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:56,780
Out you go, okay.

85
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,782
So we're keeping track of the number
of barbers that we have in use and

86
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:03,947
the number of people in line.

87
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:05,480
We'll step through this.

88
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,650
Okay so first guy shows up,
there's only one guy,

89
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,330
he's not waiting for
anybody, so there he goes.

90
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,824
Not the fastest guy ever.

91
00:05:19,678 --> 00:05:21,305
So one person's being used.

92
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:25,140
Next guy shows up, we still don't
have a queue bigger than three.

93
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,170
I got to speed these guys up.

94
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:34,620
So there's only one server so
the queue size is one now.

95
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,420
Next guy shows up,

96
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,848
queue size is going to bump up to two.

97
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:45,890
Next guy shows up,
let's see what happens to the queue size.

98
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:53,638
That's interesting.

99
00:05:53,638 --> 00:05:56,260
Now three, I needed to click,
another guy shows up.

100
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,326
Now, something is gonna happen here.

101
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:01,612
The queue is greater or equal to three so
we go through an alter block and

102
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,130
now we have two servers,
see what happened?

103
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,805
We have two servers because we
went through the alter block.

104
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:08,744
And the queue went down to two.

105
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:11,196
The guy showed up, so
then it popped back up to three.

106
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:13,206
Let me see if we have another server here.

107
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,940
The queue is three,
we're gonna add another server.

108
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,911
See look at that,
now we have three servers.

109
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,880
And you can see this is quite nice.

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,359
We're gonna keep on adding
servers until everybody's happy.

111
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,563
There's another one.

112
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:29,909
See, so we can run the simulation for
awhile.

113
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:34,365
And you'll see that occasionally,
the number of servers will go up.

114
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:40,417
By the way,
NR means the number of servers in use.

115
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:43,994
So we'll see, it's won't go above
four until we really need it.

116
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:47,781
And let's see if that ever does.

117
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,540
Well, looks like four is
probably what we needed.

118
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,210
So we're not getting these gigantic lines.

119
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,290
So four is probably a very good number for
the system.

120
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,272
Okay well,
this is a good place to end the demo.

121
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:05,552
Don't want to have you waiting around,
else the queue size will go up.

122
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:07,890
So we'll see you in the next lesson.
