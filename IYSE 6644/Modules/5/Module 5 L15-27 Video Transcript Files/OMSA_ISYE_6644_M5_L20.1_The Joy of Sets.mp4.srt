1
00:00:02,153 --> 00:00:03,060
Hi class.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,070
Well, we have interesting
lesson this time.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,082
We're gonna be talking about two of my
favorite things, set theory and joy.

4
00:00:10,082 --> 00:00:13,060
So we'll see what's in store for us.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,791
In the overview, in the last lesson
we talked about the so-called Blocks

6
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:21,150
template where we came across
all these millions and

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,993
millions of new blocks that we
could use in our simulation.

8
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:28,050
And they occasionally will help us
with specialized little issues and

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,190
we'll see a couple examples
of those coming up.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,588
And then in this lesson we're
gonna learn what sets are and

11
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:37,652
how they enhance our modeling ability.

12
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:41,491
You'll see that there
are numerous ways to use them.

13
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:45,273
So we'll especially concentrate
on what are called resource sets.

14
00:00:45,273 --> 00:00:47,374
Those are the most important things for
us right now.

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,629
Sets, as in baby math that
you learned in fourth grade,

16
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,687
a set is just a group of elements and

17
00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:02,342
elements are allowed to
belong in more than one set.

18
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:05,570
Elements can mean anything in Arena.

19
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,884
So there are various types of sets.

20
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:09,512
You have a resource set.

21
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:13,731
So a resource set would
be a set of servers.

22
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:15,410
You have a counter set.

23
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,792
Remember in a previous demo,

24
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:20,403
I showed how to do counts of certain
things as they passed through the system.

25
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:22,823
We could have a set of these counters.

26
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:25,474
We could have a set of
what are called tallies.

27
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:29,763
We could have a set of entity types,
of entity pictures, and

28
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:34,320
even more difficult things,
which we will talk about later on.

29
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:39,507
Now resource sets in particular
are very easy to construct.

30
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:44,317
What we'll do is we'll use the Set
spreadsheet in the basic process template

31
00:01:44,317 --> 00:01:45,356
to define sets.

32
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:49,077
So the Set spreadsheet is sitting there
in the basic process template, and

33
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:51,687
like I said we'll just study
resource sets for now.

34
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:53,860
Let's review what a resource is.

35
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,802
A resource currently, a vanilla
resource currently has identical,

36
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:59,412
interchangeable servers.

37
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:03,650
So if you have a resource that has
five barbers, they're all the same.

38
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,952
We don't care which is which.

39
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:06,526
We just wanna use one of them.

40
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:07,910
They're all the same to us.

41
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,966
A resource set though can have distinct
servers, Joe, Tom, Bill and they can

42
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:18,424
have different schedules, different
service speeds, different specialities.

43
00:02:18,424 --> 00:02:23,049
So in fact a resource set is much
more general than this plain

44
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:28,241
vanilla resource that itself might
have five different servers.

45
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:32,422
A resource set that can have five distinct
servers all with different properties.

46
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:36,521
In our call center example we'll have
three products with the following

47
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:37,201
recourse.

48
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:39,472
So we'll have,
in the call center, you go and

49
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:41,805
you have a question about
one of the products and

50
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:45,383
you have to talk to one of the people
associated with the three products.

51
00:02:45,383 --> 00:02:48,523
So let's see who can do what.

52
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:52,987
You have a question about product 1 you're
gonna need to talk to Charity, Noah,

53
00:02:52,987 --> 00:02:54,423
Molly, Anna, or Sammy.

54
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:55,411
One of those five.

55
00:02:55,411 --> 00:03:00,252
Product 2, you'll need talk to Tierney,
Sean, Emma, Anna and Sammy.

56
00:03:00,252 --> 00:03:05,434
So look those last two kids appear
as they did in product one.

57
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:10,382
So you're allowed to have people
appearing in multiple sets.

58
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:14,944
And then product 3 set, you'll need to
talk to Shelley, Jenny, Christie, Molly,

59
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,952
Anna, and Sammy.

60
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:19,673
The reason I call them kids by the way
is that these are actually the kids of

61
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:21,571
the people who wrote the Arena book.

62
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:23,373
They're no longer kids, but

63
00:03:23,373 --> 00:03:27,128
you can see that some of these
kids have cross functionality.

64
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:30,875
And you'll notice that I've listed
them at the ends of those lists,

65
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:35,204
because it turns out you can order sets,
unlike what you learned in math class,

66
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:36,383
sets can be ordered.

67
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,446
And what I'm doing, I'm saving
the most talented guys for last,

68
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:42,132
because you don't wanna waste
them if you don't need to.

69
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:46,603
So all 11 of these servers, by the way,
have different schedules too.

70
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:49,840
So not only do they have
different specialities,

71
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,950
they have different schedules
that they adhere to.

72
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,300
Now continuing with resource sets,

73
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,105
let's say I wanna define
a resource set called product 1.

74
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:05,410
What I'll do is when I get to
the spreadsheet, I choose Type = Resource,

75
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,715
because there is other types of sets,
so the type of this set is resource,

76
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:15,790
I click in members and I enter
Product 1 servers under Resource Name.

77
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,442
But here's what it looks like.

78
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:20,562
This is what the resource
spreadsheet looks like.

79
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:25,525
You can see we have numerous
types of set spreadsheet.

80
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:28,055
I have numerous types of sets,
Product 1 is a resource set.

81
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:30,472
Product 2 also a resource set.

82
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:31,711
We have a tally set.

83
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:33,393
Don't worry about these for now.

84
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:35,453
We'll just look at these resource sets.

85
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:38,691
And I chose type people to resource.

86
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:42,983
I click in members and then I just start
clicking in the members of that set.

87
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,501
Charity, Noah, Molly, Anna and Sammy.

88
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:47,691
Just like I listed on the previous page.

89
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:49,070
See, there's the type.

90
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,522
I'm gonna click into the number rows
there, and I just start typing away.

91
00:04:53,522 --> 00:04:56,611
Now Product 1's Preferred Order,

92
00:04:56,611 --> 00:05:01,003
all things considered,
I wanna use Charity first.

93
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:04,882
I wanna wait to use Anna and Sammy
because of their cross-functionality.

94
00:05:04,882 --> 00:05:07,750
I could use those guys for
other purposes later on.

95
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,952
So Charity goes first.

96
00:05:08,952 --> 00:05:12,122
If she's not available, I try Noah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

97
00:05:12,122 --> 00:05:16,022
I saved Sammy for last,
because he's cross-functional.

98
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:18,762
And it'll turn out, by the way,
that other orders are possible.

99
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:20,321
We'll talk about that in a minute.

100
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:26,642
Now when I do a seize-delay-release of
people associated with a resource set.

101
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:30,181
So I wanna seize one of
these Product 1 workers.

102
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:33,018
I've got to be very, very, very careful.

103
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:38,143
I have to be careful because, and
there's a little your pre-warning sign.

104
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:42,811
The problem is that you have to
make sure that you release the same

105
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:45,932
exact person that you originally seized.

106
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:50,045
You just can't say seize-release
arbitrarily, cuz if you release a random

107
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:53,470
server some other customer may say hey,
where'd my server go.

108
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,063
So you've got to be very careful
about the person that you release.

109
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:00,471
If you seize Sammy,
you gotta release Sammy.

110
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:01,979
So here's what it looks like.

111
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,312
Seize-Delay-Release using the advance
process blocks, Seize-Delay-Release.

112
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:11,590
Let's suppose we seize a server from
the set Product 1 in this preferred order,

113
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,920
from top to bottom.

114
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,612
And we got to make sure
we remember who it was.

115
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:19,000
And then when we're done,
we got to release that same guy.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,982
Here's how we do it.

117
00:06:19,982 --> 00:06:24,662
Let's go to the seize block and
you'll see I click on the seize, and

118
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:29,730
I've got this, it looks like this
complicated bunch of stuff here.

119
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,616
So let's click onto what amounts to add or
edit.

120
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:38,084
And you'll see that the type
of seize we've done is that

121
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:42,282
we've seized a set,
the set is called product one.

122
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:45,702
We seize a quantity of one
in preferred order, and

123
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:50,355
we save the name of that guy in
an attribute called tech agent index.

124
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:53,031
I'm gonna go over this again,
cuz it's complicated.

125
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:57,353
The release looks like this,
same kind of mess up here but

126
00:06:57,353 --> 00:07:01,513
I'm gonna do a release from
the set called Product 1.

127
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:07,563
I'm gonna release one guy, and
now I'm gonna release a specific member.

128
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:12,342
Namely, the person whoever it
is stored in Tech Agent Index.

129
00:07:12,342 --> 00:07:17,613
So seize one guy from the set called
Product 1 in the Preferred Order.

130
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:20,931
One guy from Product 1
in the Preferred Order.

131
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:27,341
And whoever that is, I'm gonna store in
an attribute called Tech Agent Index.

132
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:30,271
So if I see Sammy, I'm gonna remember,

133
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:35,631
Tech Agent Index is gonna remember that
I as a customer have seized Sammy.

134
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:38,091
So that name is stored in the attribute.

135
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,093
Now I realize that attributes
only store numbers but

136
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:45,524
let me just assure you that the name Sammy
is associated with a number as well,

137
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:48,064
which you don't need to know about, okay?

138
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:51,110
Then when I do the release
sometime later on,

139
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,841
I'm no longer releasing in preferred
order, I'm releasing Sammy,

140
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:59,941
a Specific Member who's stored
in Tech Agent Index, okay?

141
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:02,767
So once I've got him once I seized him,

142
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:06,802
he now becomes a specific
number that I need to release.

143
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:08,031
So some remarks.

144
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:11,812
Various seize selection rules
are possible, not just preferred order.

145
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:16,060
I could seize cyclically and this allows
me to run through the servers and

146
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,160
not tiring any of them out.

147
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,150
I can seize randomly,
i can seize in preferred order,

148
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,471
I can seize specific member,
largest remaining capacity.

149
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:29,473
Now if I seize like barber, barber
himself, there may be five barbers, and

150
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:34,728
so I'll seize whatever resource has
the largest number of servers remaining.

151
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,083
So I could seize barber,
I could seize manicurist.

152
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,444
If there were five barbers remaining and
only three manicurists,

153
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:42,372
I'd seize one of those five barbers.

154
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:43,942
So this is really general.

155
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:46,952
I could seize the resource
with the smallest number busy.

156
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:48,182
There's all sorts of stuff I can do.

157
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:50,719
And this stuff is gonna be very
useful when we do our call

158
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,943
center example later on.

159
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:53,582
So now, demo time.

160
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:56,253
I'm going to do a simple
model with four servers.

161
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:58,902
And you'll see it's quite easy.

162
00:08:58,902 --> 00:09:01,602
He's a summary of what we did.

163
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:05,801
How joyful, we introduced sets,
and especially resource sets.

164
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:11,021
And then I showed how to use these
