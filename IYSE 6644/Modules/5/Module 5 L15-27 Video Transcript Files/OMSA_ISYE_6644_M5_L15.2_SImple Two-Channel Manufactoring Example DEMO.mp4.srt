00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,740
Hi, everybody, we're gonna demo
this small, electronic assembly and

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,890
manufacturing system that we've
been talking about in the lesson.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,190
Notice that we have two
different types of arrivals.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,243
Part As, they show up exponentially
every 5 minutes on average.

5
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:20,685
I think that's what we had
in the specifications.

6
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:22,598
The point is they show up 1 at a time.

7
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:30,874
Part Bs, they show up every 30 minutes,
but they show up 4 at a time.

8
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:34,020
And you'll see when I run it,
you'll see, I need to also show you.

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,032
See, the Entity Type,
which we defined in the Create module for

10
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:40,721
Part As is called Part A, what a surprise.

11
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:44,556
And Part Bs are called Part B.

12
00:00:44,556 --> 00:00:49,036
Now the critical assigns that make
the whole thing work are, remember,

13
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:50,733
I say we have a Sealer Time?

14
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:55,704
And I'm assigning an attribute called
Sealer Time to the triangular distribution

15
00:00:55,704 --> 00:00:56,634
of your Part A.

16
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:59,300
It's gonna be Weibull
distribution of your Part B.

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,871
I also assign the Arrive Time
as an attribute called TNOW,

18
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:07,246
which I discussed in the lesson, itself.

19
00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:10,730
For Part Bs, same thing,
except the Sealer Time is Weibull,

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,544
which we'll use in the future.

21
00:01:12,544 --> 00:01:15,080
And the arrive time is still TNOW.

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,920
Here's the Prep A Process,
Part As go here.

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,040
We just do a Seize Delay Release
on Prep A, totally boring.

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,180
Same thing with Prep B.

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,057
Sealer Process is the only
thing that's interesting here.

26
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:34,294
And there it is,
I do a Seize Delay Release on the Sealer.

27
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:38,043
And instead of exponential sealer times,

28
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:42,422
the expression that we use
is called sealer time.

29
00:01:42,422 --> 00:01:45,964
And that's defined as an attribute
back in these assign blocks.

30
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:50,431
So if I get over here to the Sealer,
and it wants to know the sealer time,

31
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:54,095
it says you're a Part A,
I'll use that sealer time.

32
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:58,607
Or, you're a Part B,
I'll use this sealer time, right.

33
00:01:58,607 --> 00:02:04,913
Then we undergo the inspection,
this is just a 2-way by Chance.

34
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:11,180
And it goes with 9% chance to the right,
91% chance down, where it's shipped off.

35
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,830
There's a rework here,
more inspections here, and the exit there.

36
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,900
Let's see what the think looks like.

37
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,140
I've purposely slowed this down so
you can see the pretty little marbles.

38
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,323
It's still, yeah,
it's still too fast, really, so

39
00:02:25,323 --> 00:02:28,010
what did we learn how to do last time?

40
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,150
Go to Run > Setup, and
let's see, > Run Speed, and

41
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,150
we'll slow it down a little more.

42
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,640
Amazingly, I'd already slowed it down
beforehand, but let's run it again.

43
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,040
Okay, you can see, there's the red marble.

44
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,070
And one, two, three, and
fourth guy shows up.

45
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,340
Four blue marbles,
there's one being served here.

46
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,810
Three in line,
four more are about to show up.

47
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:01,330
One, two, three, four,
there are now seven line here.

48
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,350
See, they're showing up in groups of four.

49
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,859
Now there's only six in line
cuz one just got processed.

50
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,050
So you can see this is very,
very nice, straightforward system.

51
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,390
I'm speeding it up now, finally.

52
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,170
And if you run it long enough,

53
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:23,610
you'll see various colorful lines
forming over here the Sealer Process.

54
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,704
But it's a very straightforward model now.

55
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:30,764
The only thing I think I'll
do is that I'll show you

56
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:33,130
what the full run looks like.

57
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:38,040
So let's hit the go fast button, and
it looks like, this is interesting.

58
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,170
We did 3 replications for 24 hours,
that's what the 3 means here.

59
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,040
Let's look at the results.

60
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,500
What a lovely chance to look
at Crystal Reports, again.

61
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,510
Boy, I'm never gonna tire of
complaining about Crystal Reports.

62
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,715
So maybe we'll have some music that we
can listen to while this is going on.

63
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:59,739
[MUSIC]

64
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,518
Get your favorite snack out as we wait.

65
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:07,277
[MUSIC]

66
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:09,970
And here we go, so you can see,
we have 3 replications.

67
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,700
And this is the Category Overview, so

68
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,060
what it's showing us is that we'll look at
the values across all the replications.

69
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,917
So you can see that Part As had
to wait 0.46 units on average.

70
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:28,972
I think we're in hours,
Part Bs, a little bit more.

71
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:31,771
And the total time in the system,
it's quite nice.

72
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:38,085
This is the additional
information on work in process.

73
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:41,496
So you can see, if you go to the reports,
lots of interesting things.

74
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:45,680
Okay, I'm gonna show one more small demo.

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,560
And it looks exactly the same
as the previous one,

76
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,120
except I'm changing my server logic.

77
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,374
And right here,
we have this assigned block that

78
00:04:56,374 --> 00:04:59,811
supposedly contains the Sealer Time.

79
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:01,492
In fact, I'm not gonna use it.

80
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:03,610
What I'm gonna do,
let's click into the Sealer.

81
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,990
And there's that logic
that I told you about.

82
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,524
And so you just believe me
that when I run this thing,

83
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:19,060
Look at it go, we get pretty much
the same type of behavior in the system.

84
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:25,202
The random numbers are,
The uniforms that the thing uses to

85
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:30,350
run are evoked in a slightly different
order cuz I changed things around.

86
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,389
But basically, you're getting
the same results from this run,

87
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,510
even though I used logic instead
of the assignments over here.

88
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,170
So very nice, okay, that ends this demo,
and I'll see you in the next lesson.
