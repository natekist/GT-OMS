1
00:00:02,156 --> 00:00:06,277
Now that we've done this call center demo,
I'm gonna do a few additional

2
00:00:06,277 --> 00:00:10,607
specialty demos, and we'll describe
them in a little bit of detail as we go.

3
00:00:10,607 --> 00:00:13,520
You'll see kinda the wide range
of things that Arena can do.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,240
Here's the overview.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,610
Last lesson,
we did that call center simulation demo.

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,432
This time, I'll give a plain English
description of a simple inventory system,

7
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:25,790
an (s,S) inventory model, and a demo.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,641
In the next few lessons, well, we'll look
at several demos like I just promised.

9
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:33,100
Inventory model for now.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,448
A quickie little demo on whether you
should use one line versus two lines.

11
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:43,316
What's called a re-entrant queue,
that's a lot of fun.

12
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:46,711
Things called SMARTS files and
other Rockwell demos,

13
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:48,710
these are all Rockwell things.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,010
And then a manufacturing
system with transporters,

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,380
conveyors, and various forms of movement.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,757
Here's a description of the (s,S)
inventory policy that we'll be looking at

17
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:02,803
in the current demo.

18
00:01:02,803 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm gonna simulate the widget
inventory of some stock over time.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,800
And we'll be using modules from
the Basic and Advanced panels.

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,370
Customer arrivals, a form of Poisson
process, Exponential 0.1 interarrivals.

21
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,500
So we have about ten arrivals
per day of customers.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,109
The demand size uses the DISC function,

23
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:26,370
which we've mentioned once or
twice before.

24
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,886
That's a discreet distribution.

25
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:29,970
I'll mention what it
is when we look at it.

26
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,017
Demand is always quote unquote met.

27
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:37,875
So even if you don't have stock,
we backlog so eventually it's met.

28
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,341
You never send a guy away angry.

29
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:44,659
Inventory is taken, or evaluated,
at the start of each day.

30
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:48,481
You only notice that you're understocked
at the beginning of each day.

31
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:50,240
If you run out of stock, too bad.

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,899
You just backlog, backlog, backlog.

33
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,900
If inventory is below s, we order up to S,
that's the (s,S) inventory policy.

34
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,555
If s is 5 and S is 20, and
you end up with an inventory of 4

35
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:07,837
at the beginning of the day,
you order 16 that day.

36
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:11,162
The delivery lead time is
a uniform distribution,

37
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:16,270
takes more then half a day but less
then a full day before an order arrives.

38
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,390
It's pretty quick, but
by the time the order arrives

39
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,540
other customers will have also
arrived depleting inventory further.

40
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,517
That's an issue.

41
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:27,868
There are order costs like
set up costs for an order.

42
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:30,561
Incremental cost,
the more you order the more it costs.

43
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:35,070
Holding costs, if you've got stuff in
stock it costs you money to hold it.

44
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,300
And penalty costs, just because
orders are all eventually filled

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,730
doesn't mean that you don't pay
a penalty for having to backlog.

46
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,790
Maybe customers noticed that you didn't
have it in stock and they're ticked off.

47
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,480
Now what we'll do is that using all these
various costs, we wanna automatically

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,940
calculate average total cost
per day over a 120 day period.

49
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,917
And I'll show you how we set that up.

50
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:02,582
This is gonna involve some statistics
that you'll have to figure out how to use

51
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,295
yourself.

52
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:05,250
But I'll show you where that's contained.

53
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,990
Inventory, unit costs,
like how much does it cost to order, and

54
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,980
things like that, these, and
all other parameters, are variables.

55
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,040
So I'll show you the list of variables.

56
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,789
Inventory is decremented by demands,
incremented by received orders.

57
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:23,336
So demand comes in,
we decrement inventory.

58
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:27,585
When we receive an order, after
the lead time, we increment inventory.

59
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:30,280
Interarrival times, demands, lead times,

60
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,720
these are all expressions that we get
from the Advanced Process template.

61
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,599
Expressions come from advanced processes.

62
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,200
It's a little piece of
trivia that I always forget.

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,790
Accumulated costs are calculated
in the Statistic spreadsheet

64
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,890
that's located in
the Advanced Process panel.

65
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,630
So it's a spreadsheet
in the Advanced panel.

66
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,432
Daily inventory review is conducted by a
fake customer at the beginning of the day.

67
00:03:55,432 --> 00:04:01,397
In this lesson, we took a little time
to discuss the (s,S) inventory policy.

68
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:04,450
Not the most complicated one,
but certainly an interesting one.

69
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,844
In the next lesson,
I'll look at that old Dr.

70
00:04:08,844 --> 00:04:12,028
Seuss demo, One Line,
Two Lines, Red Line, Blue Line.

71
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:20,009
