1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,606
I'll be doing a demo on
this manufacturing cell.

2
00:00:02,606 --> 00:00:04,545
Let me just get the darn thing running.

3
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:06,054
It's very pretty.

4
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:07,525
Yeah, let me slow down a little bit.

5
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:12,096
You can see different types of customers,
in fact let's do that setup and

6
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:13,803
make it quite a bit slower.

7
00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:18,979
Run speed at a zero,
we're getting used to this by now.

8
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:22,384
See different types of customers,
blue, red and

9
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:25,070
green marbles going around the place.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,921
They actually have different
paths that they're travelling.

11
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:33,002
The blue guys go from cell 1,
2, 3 and 4 in that order.

12
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:38,503
The red guys go, if I remember 1,
2, 4, 2, 3, in that order.

13
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:41,496
The green guys, I think, are 2, 1, 3.

14
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:42,971
But you can see they're all moving around.

15
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:45,624
They have different sequences.

16
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:48,409
And here's the code.

17
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:52,579
I'm just gonna do this in very,
very high level language.

18
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:57,434
Parts are created, we assign them their
sequence here along with their part type.

19
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:58,766
There's a blue guy.

20
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:00,885
He goes to what's called a station.

21
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:02,924
He figures out what his
sequence is gonna be.

22
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:07,291
And the blue guy's, let's wait for a blue
one, he'll go to Station 1, 2, 3 and 4,

23
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,481
and now there's blue.

24
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:10,893
See right there, Station 1.

25
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:13,890
He pops over,
now he's gonna go to station 2, see there.

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,963
Then he's gonna go to station 3 and
in a second he's going to go to station 4.

27
00:01:16,963 --> 00:01:18,659
Let's watch for him over here.

28
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,659
Come on go to Station 4.

29
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:23,927
He'll show up in a second.

30
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:24,940
Come on, come on.

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:32,494
He really will unless there might have
been a line at Station 3, there we go.

32
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:35,692
So he goes to Station 4 and
then he's out of there.

33
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:37,713
So it's very, very nice.

34
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:42,630
And the only thing you need
is the sequence block,

35
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,386
use of sequences in this route block.

36
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:48,875
So route just says,
where we gonna go next?

37
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,199
And it says in plan
English in transfer time,

38
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:56,138
in this case this is a variable
of length two minutes.

39
00:01:56,138 --> 00:02:01,840
So it takes two minutes to go to the next
place by sequence by your sequence.

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,160
That's all you need to do and
all this stuff is in the so

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,157
called advanced transfer template
which I have loaded here.

42
00:02:11,157 --> 00:02:16,484
You can see this is the sequence
spreadsheet, and it's very, very nice.

43
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:19,125
If I want the route block,
I just drag it over.

44
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,082
Stations are just places that you go.

45
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:25,954
So you can see that it's
very easy to run this model,

46
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:31,164
take about an hour to learn how to do it,
but that's for another time.

47
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:38,117
The last thing I wanna show you then is
I can do movement involving a machine.

48
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,789
In this case, a transporter.

49
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:42,847
So see the little green thing there?

50
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:48,067
This is just a guy that picks you up,
like a taxi cab or a cart.

51
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,245
And let's run this.

52
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:55,542
He picks up a customer too, drops him
off at Cell 1, and then he's free.

53
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,690
And then he's not free anymore,
he's gonna go over and get the next guy.

54
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:02,876
And when they move they're not free.

55
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:09,621
I'm gonna go back here and wait for
the next guy, picks him up, drops him off.

56
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,580
Isn't that nice?

57
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,204
And if I want,
just the last thing I'll show you.

58
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:16,309
If I don't think that these
are enough transporters,

59
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:17,642
let me move these a little faster.

60
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:23,403
If I don't think that I have enough
transporters, maybe I don't.

61
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,200
I can go to the Advance Transfer.

62
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,275
Transporter spreadsheet.

63
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:32,880
Let's make four of them.

64
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,661
Isn't this easy?

65
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:39,393
And now rerun it.

66
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:47,050
And see now I have four transporters
moving around, so easy.

67
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,988
And so I'll give you a small assignment
that you can play around with this

68
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:50,574
a little bit.

69
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:52,645
You don't have to do
the programming itself though.

70
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:55,742
Okay, well that ends this
last demo of the module.

71
00:03:55,742 --> 00:03:57,390
I hope you had a nice time looking at it.
