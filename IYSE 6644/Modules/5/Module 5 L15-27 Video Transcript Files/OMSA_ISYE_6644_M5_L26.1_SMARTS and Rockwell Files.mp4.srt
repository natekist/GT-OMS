00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,595
In this class, I'm finally gonna get smart
by looking at Arena SMARTS files and

2
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:08,990
Rockwell demos.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,380
Rockwell is the company that owns Arena.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,102
These are hidden gems that you
can find and play around with.

5
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:17,636
I actually like Playing
around with the SMARTS files,

6
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:20,179
during the commercials while
I'm watching a TV show.

7
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:21,373
So these are fun.

8
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:24,063

>> All over the word, the word for

9
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:26,433
great coffee flavor is NescafÃ©.

11
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:33,395
>> Here's the overview, last time,
I looked at that nutty re-entrant Q and

12
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:37,206
the crazy behavior In this lesson,
I'm gonna look at these little gems,

13
00:00:37,206 --> 00:00:40,280
the SMART files and the Rockwell demos.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,440
And like I said, it makes great
commercial and bedtime reading.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,910
These are very nice little tutorial files
that are organized by subject area and

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,143
occasionally help you with difficult
problems that you might not otherwise be

17
00:00:53,143 --> 00:00:56,310
able to get,
using Arena's terrible help menus.

18
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,190
For example,
there's SMARTS files to create customers

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,370
with a time-dependent arrival rate that
varies according to some equation.

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,470
That's interesting.

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,030
And, in fact, there are 100s of
SMARTS files that you can use.

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,730
That's why I look at them for fun.

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,690
Rockwell also has many
prepared professional demos.

24
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,860
I'm gonna show you one
of each of these things.

25
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,380
To look for these guys,
you have to sniff around a little bit.

26
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,040
On my implementation, if I go to
Libraries, Documents, Rockwell software,

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,890
Arena, that's where you'll find it.

28
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,550
It may differ a little
bit on your computer.

29
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,360
And I'll demo a couple of typical
examples, for instance, SMARTS files,

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,290
where arrival rates vary
according to expression,

31
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,709
things like this, emergency room,
these are all very nice little demos.

32
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,045
The summary of what we did in this lesson,
very simple,

33
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:44,590
I looked at several cool Rockwell SMARTS,
and demo files.

34
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,460
And in the next lesson,
I'm gonna look at a very

35
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,200
easy looking, yet extremely
sophisticated manufacturing cell.

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,270
And I'll do an allusion to variations,

37
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,910
including transporters and
conveyors for that cell.

38
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,263
That's sort of a more advanced concept,
but it's fun to look at.

39
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:06,550
So, we'll talk about that next time.

40
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,694
See you then.
