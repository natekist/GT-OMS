1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,549
[NOISE] All operators are busy
at this time, please hold.

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,668
>> Well, now we're finally gonna do our
call center demo, and what I'll do is I'm

3
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:13,077
gonna describe a little bit of what
we can expect to see in the demo.

4
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:17,703
Lesson overview is that,
in the last lesson I described in plain

5
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:21,750
English what was going on
in the call center model.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,310
So I just talked and talked and

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,440
talked about all the stuff that
was going on in the model.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,013
We didn't do a demo,
that's what we're gonna do this time.

9
00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:28,570
Demo time.

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,400
Now, what we've done is
that we're putting together

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,360
lots of different ideas from
many of the recent lessons.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,900
Everything from sort of this concept
of fake customers to resource sets.

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,880
All of that takes place in this demo.

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,170
Let's be on the lookout for
the following things.

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,736
Keep an eye out for these things.

16
00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:52,139
Submodels, that's that funny-looking
icon that I showed you right at

17
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:54,240
the beginning of the last lesson.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,185
Fake customers used as timers.

19
00:00:58,185 --> 00:01:01,943
We're gonna use a queue
with a capacity of 0.

20
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:07,257
This is they kick you out
of the hotel if it's full.

21
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:12,300
So we'll kick customers out if
all 26 phone lines are busy.

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,753
You don't even get a chance.

23
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:18,638
Non-Homogeneous Poisson arrivals.

24
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:23,076
Three resource sets for tech support,
each one of which has a especially

25
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:27,896
a product type one, two, or three,
and there's some cross functionality.

26
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:32,968
Tricky Seize-Delay-Releases, we've
talked about those a couple times now.

27
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:37,024
And quirky callback procedures.

28
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,140
Now it's demo time.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,282
You'll be seeing the following
interesting screenshots.

30
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:48,660
This is a Top-Level View of the model
with the various submodels displayed.

31
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,900
This is what Tech Support looks like.

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,805
So you click into that Tech Support
Submodel up here, you click into that and

33
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:56,100
you get this mess.

34
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,840
This is the Time Period Counter.

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,922
Its only job is to click off 1, 2,
3, up to 22, cuz there's 22 half

36
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:08,194
hour periods in an 11 hour day, to keep
track of what period of the day is it.

37
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,120
And then the Arrival Submodel.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,020
We've actually looked at a very,
very close variation of this thing before.

39
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,810
This is the arrivals where we
use that cube block etc, etc.
