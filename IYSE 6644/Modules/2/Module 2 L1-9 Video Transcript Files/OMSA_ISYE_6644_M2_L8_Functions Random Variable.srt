00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,960
- Hi everybody, welcome back.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,519
Today I'll be looking at
functions of a random variable

3
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:09,002
as I continue the probability primer.

4
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:10,141
Let's get into that.

5
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:12,876
The lesson overview for now is, well,

6
00:00:12,876 --> 00:00:14,314
what did we do last time?

7
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,998
I looked at tons of moments,
and moment generating functions

8
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:21,613
and I hope we had a lot of fun there.

9
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:23,728
In this lesson, let's suppose I know

10
00:00:23,728 --> 00:00:25,470
everything about a random variable,

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,293
not only the moments, just everything.

12
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,163
What can I say about functions
of the random variable?

13
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,897
In particular, what's the distribution

14
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:34,149
going to be looking like?

15
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:36,994
And this has absolutely huge
implications in this course,

16
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:40,727
especially in random variant generation.

17
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:42,186
Here's the problem in general.

18
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:44,091
Let's suppose I have a random variable, X,

19
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,698
and I completely know the
probability mass function

20
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:48,365
of the probability density function.

21
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:51,193
In either case, it's F of X.

22
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:55,273
Let's look at the function of
X, H of X, I'll call that Y.

23
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:59,187
We saw h of X notation when I
used LOTUS in the last lesson.

24
00:00:59,187 --> 00:01:02,704
Let's let this arbitrary
function of X be denoted by Y

25
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:05,902
and what I want now is I want g of Y,

26
00:01:05,902 --> 00:01:08,069
the PMF or PDF of Y.

27
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,263
So, I've got the PMF or PDF of X,

28
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:14,880
now what's the PMF or PDF
of that function of X.

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,800
It's very important. Here's some examples.

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,930
And, take my word on
this, that these work.

31
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,318
It turns out, if X is
normal, normal zero one,

32
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:25,337
we'll talk about that
distribution later on,

33
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:27,739
it so happens that if I
take the square of that

34
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,478
I get a chi-square distribution.

35
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:32,084
Even if you don't know what those are,

36
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:34,152
if I square a normal, I get a chi-square,

37
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:36,599
it's because of this lecture.

38
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,588
Now, let's look at a uniform distribution.

39
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:40,939
Let's suppose I start with a nice,

40
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:42,963
easy, uniform zero one distribution.

41
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:44,291
We've actually seen this.

42
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,749
If I take the function
negative one over Lambda,

43
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:50,480
a natural log of that
uniform, I get an exponential.

44
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,693
Amazing!

45
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:53,426
So, I start with a uniform.

46
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:56,806
I plug the uniform into
this little equation here.

47
00:01:56,806 --> 00:01:58,947
Negative one over Lambda, natural log of U

48
00:01:58,947 --> 00:02:02,423
and I miraculously get an
exponential Lambda distribution.

49
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:06,590
This has huge implications
in random variant generation.

50
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,639
So, let's start off with a
very easy, discrete example.

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,163
I'm gonna let X denote

52
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:14,655
the number of heads from two coin tosses

53
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:16,797
and I'm gonna derive

54
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:21,435
the PMF for this function of
X Y equals X cubed minus X.

55
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,877
So anyway, let's look
at the PMF of X first.

56
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,184
X is the PMF from two coin tosses,

57
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:29,006
so it can equal zero, one, or two,

58
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:30,566
with corresponding probabilities,

59
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:32,734
a quarter, a half, and a quarter.

60
00:02:32,734 --> 00:02:36,104
So, let's look at the
corresponding values for Y.

61
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:40,661
If X equals zero, then Y equals
X cubed minus X equals zero.

62
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,845
If X equals one, then Y also equals zero.

63
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:46,921
And if X equals two, then Y equals

64
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,376
X cubed minus X equals six.

65
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:52,018
So, you can see, the values
of X equals zero and one

66
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,108
map into Y equals zero

67
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,582
and the value of X equals zero

68
00:02:55,582 --> 00:02:57,783
maps into Y equals six.

69
00:02:57,783 --> 00:02:59,496
So, what does this imply?

70
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:01,335
Let's add up the probabilities.

71
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:03,100
The probability the Y equals zero

72
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,329
is the probability that
X equals zero or one.

73
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:10,280
Add those up. A quarter plus
a half equals three quarters.

74
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,733
The only other possibility
for Y, is Y equals six.

75
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,985
The probability of that is one quarter.

76
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:17,377
I didn't have to do much thinking there.

77
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:19,071
That corresponds to X equals 2.

78
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:21,925
So, in other words, the probability that

79
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:23,780
Y equals zero is three quarters.

80
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,197
The probability that Y
equals six is one quarter.

81
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:28,732
That is my PMF of Y.

82
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:30,583
Very, very easy.

83
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,235
Let's do a continuous example.

84
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,890
This one's a little bit more challenging.

85
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,396
Now suppose X has PDF,
because it's continuous.

86
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:40,479
F of X equals absolute value of X.

87
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:45,214
This is gonna be defined for X
between negative one and one.

88
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:48,721
It looks like this, sort
of a reverse triangle.

89
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:50,634
It goes from minus one to one

90
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:54,513
and you can see that if you
take the integral of this thing,

91
00:03:54,513 --> 00:03:55,812
you can almost see in your head

92
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:59,106
that it integrates to one.
It's a legitimate PDF.

93
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,938
Given that is my starting point,

94
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:05,376
let's find the PDF of the
function Y equals X squared.

95
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:07,381
Okay, well, here's what you do.

96
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,609
Here's how you find these things.

97
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:11,561
I'm gonna find the CDF first, CDF of Y.

98
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:13,263
Then, I'll take the derivative.

99
00:04:13,263 --> 00:04:15,515
So, this is the usual way
you do these problems.

100
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:17,871
You find the CDF first, then
you take the derivative.

101
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:19,621
Here's the CDF.

102
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:22,571
Now, I want to do as
little thinking as possible

103
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,600
because I'm totally lazy,

104
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,256
so let's just kinda do
things by the book here.

105
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:30,670
The CDF of Y is capital G of Y

106
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,390
and that is, by definition,
the probability that

107
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,465
Y is less than or equal to little Y.

108
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:37,101
That's just by definition,
no thought whatsoever, okay?

109
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:40,251
Again, in my quest not to do any thinking,

110
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,538
let's just plug in. What is Y?

111
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:45,005
It's X squared, so that's the probability

112
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:46,517
that X squared is less than or equal to Y.

113
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:49,986
And, now, let's remember that
I only know stuff about X.

114
00:04:49,986 --> 00:04:51,811
I know everything there
is to know about X.

115
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:53,244
I don't know this X squared stuff.

116
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:55,895
So, how do I transform X squared to X?

117
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,547
Well, you take the square root,

118
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,811
so that's what this next step is.

119
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:00,944
The probability that
X squared is less than

120
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:02,446
or equal to Y is the probability that

121
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:04,915
X is between negative square root of Y

122
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:06,206
and plus square root of Y.

123
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,192
We had to be a little careful

124
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:08,163
when we take the square root

125
00:05:08,163 --> 00:05:09,750
to remember that minus part.

126
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,052
Okay, well, what is this now?

127
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:15,132
By definition, it's the
integral of F of X DX

128
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:17,440
from negative square root of Y

129
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,652
to plus square root of Y

130
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,498
and F of X is square root of X.

131
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:26,080
After a little algebra, you
get that result equals Y,

132
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,431
and so, I can get the PDF of Y
now by taking the derivative.

133
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,188
The derivative of the CDF is the PDF

134
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:34,543
and even I can take the derivative

135
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,443
of capital G of Y equals Y.

136
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:39,665
That's just little G of Y equals one.

137
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:41,436
And what that means then,

138
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:43,665
is that Y is uniform zero one

139
00:05:43,665 --> 00:05:45,979
because that is the PDF of a uniform.

140
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,641
So, if you start out with F of X equals

141
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:52,371
absolute value of X,
from negative one to one;

142
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:53,613
I square it.

143
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:56,654
Unbelievably, I get a
uniform distribution.

144
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:57,873
And, maybe, I'll give you a

145
00:05:57,873 --> 00:05:59,252
homework assignment on that sometime.

146
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:00,862
You'll see for yourself that it works.

147
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,144
Even if you use simulation,

148
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:04,532
you'll get a nice uniform distribution.

149
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,574
So, this phenomenon is related to

150
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,869
what's called the Inverse
Transform theorem.

151
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,785
This is a fantastic theorem that's used

152
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:12,516
all the time in simulation.

153
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:14,211
You'll see why in a little while.

154
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:16,817
Let's suppose that X is a
continuous random variable

155
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:20,274
and the CDF is denoted
capital F of X, as usual.

156
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:23,249
Unbelievably and amazingly
and stupendously,

157
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,977
capital F of capital X, so this thing

158
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,994
is a nasty random variable.

159
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:30,339
Capital F of little x is a CDF.

160
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:33,286
That's just a function of real numbers,

161
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:37,613
but capital F of capital X
is a nasty random variable.

162
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:39,054
But, we don't have any problems with that.

163
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:40,080
It's just some random variable.

164
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,147
If I plug capital X into it's own CDF,

165
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:46,165
amazingly, I get a uniform distribution.

166
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:47,598
That's what this theorem says.

167
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:50,007
Here's the proof and I'll
just do this very quickly.

168
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:51,256
We're gonna see the proof again,

169
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:54,383
so don't worry about it
if these steps are scary.

170
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:58,026
We'll let capital Y equal
Capital F of capital X,

171
00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:59,917
so it's just a nasty function of X.

172
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,935
Then the CDF of Y is,

173
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:03,864
let's do as little thought as possible,

174
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:05,999
the probability that Y is less than

175
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:07,513
or equal to little Y,
that is by definition.

176
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:10,502
Now, I'm lazy. I don't
know nothing about Y.

177
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:12,782
So, let's plug in what Y equals;

178
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:14,295
capital F of capital X.

179
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:16,038
That's all that we've done here.

180
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:19,591
Now, I only know about X,
so what I'm gonna do is,

181
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:21,333
I'll take the inverse of both sides.

182
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,173
So, in this step right here,

183
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:28,340
I take capital F inverse
of capital F on both sides;

184
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:32,676
the F inverse of both sides
gives me the next step.

185
00:07:32,676 --> 00:07:35,872
Probability that X is less than
or equal to F inverse of Y.

186
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,453
Where did the capital F go?

187
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:42,015
Well, when I did the inverse of F times F,

188
00:07:42,015 --> 00:07:44,997
I got a cancellation, and so,

189
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,034
that's why I'm left
with a plain old X then.

190
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,732
Alright, well, this is
gonna happen a second time.

191
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:52,248
Let's do the probability that X

192
00:07:52,248 --> 00:07:55,173
is less than or equal
to the F inverse of Y.

193
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:59,340
By definition, that's
capital F of F inverse of Y.

194
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:04,585
The F and the F inverse
cancel again and I get Y.

195
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,849
If I take the derivative,
just like before,

196
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:08,882
I get the uniform distribution.

197
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:10,187
So, that's the proof.

198
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:13,031
Very, very ,very nice.

199
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:13,934
And, we're gonna encounter this

200
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:15,882
a couple other times very soon.

201
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:17,625
It's just tremendously important

202
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,996
to generating random
variables during a simulation.

203
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:21,575
Let's do a simple example now,

204
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:23,310
to show how to generate random variables.

205
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,739
In particular, the
exponential distribution.

206
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,851
I'm gonna use the Inverse
Transform Theorem to do this.

207
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:29,170
So, let's start out real easy.

208
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,157
Let's suppose that X is exponential,

209
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:32,940
and we know from a previous lesson,

210
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,544
that the CDF is capital F of little X

211
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:39,620
that equals one minus
E to the minus Lambda X

212
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,160
for X greater than or equal to zero.

213
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,854
So, now, I'm gonna use the
Inverse Transform Theorem.

214
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:47,236
I plus in capital X into it's own CDF,

215
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,566
capital F of capital X equals

216
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:52,589
one minus E to the minus Lambda capital X.

217
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:55,209
The Inverse Transform Theorem says that,

218
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:58,194
that thing, messy as
it may be, is uniform.

219
00:08:58,194 --> 00:09:00,069
Thank you Inverse Transform Theorem.

220
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:02,648
Since it's uniform,
let's set it equal to U.

221
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:04,385
And, supposing I can generate

222
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:06,372
a uniform from Excel or some place.

223
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:10,770
So, set capital F of X
equal to U and solve for X.

224
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,603
So that's, I'm gonna take the inverse,

225
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:13,963
sort of, I'm gonna solve for X.

226
00:09:13,963 --> 00:09:16,058
After a little bit of algebra,

227
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:19,443
and we'll step throughs
later on step by step.

228
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:21,134
After a little bit of algebra,

229
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:23,010
X equals negative one over Lambda

230
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,217
natural log of one minus U.

231
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:27,902
And so, since X started
out as exponential,

232
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:30,092
that means that negative one over Lambda

233
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:33,744
natural log of one minus
U is, itself, exponential.

234
00:09:33,744 --> 00:09:36,048
So, if you can give me a uniform,

235
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:37,970
I can give you an exponential.

236
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,170
It's brilliant!

237
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,903
So, for instance, if Lambda equals two

238
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:44,542
and U equals .27, I plug
in Lambda equals two,

239
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,467
U equals .27 right there

240
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:50,140
and I get X equals .157.

241
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,805
That's my exponential to random variant

242
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,094
or realization, as they call it.

243
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,279
Here's another example.

244
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,535
This is the Weibull distribution.

245
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:59,849
I'm gonna just walk you
through this very quickly.

246
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,747
Suppose X, as the Weibull distribution,

247
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:05,101
turns out that mess is the CDF.

248
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:06,974
One minus E to the minus Lambda X,

249
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,926
all that raised to the Beta power.

250
00:10:08,926 --> 00:10:11,324
The Weibull distribution is
a complicated distribution

251
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:14,267
used in reliability theory and you can see

252
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:15,928
that if I set Beta equals one,

253
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:17,994
the exponential is
actually a special case.

254
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:20,956
So, if I set capital F of X equal to U,

255
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:24,486
just like before, and
solve for X, you can show,

256
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:26,372
do this during the commercials tonight,

257
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:29,539
that X equals one over Lambda

258
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:32,136
minus natural log one minus U,

259
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:33,875
all that raised to the
one over Beta power.

260
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,782
You can do that yourself.

261
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:36,367
That's like a little exercise for you.

262
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:37,455
And, what I'd like you to do,

263
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:38,474
if you have a little extra time,

264
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:40,845
I'll make this an
assignment at some point.

265
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:42,843
Pick your favorite
values of Lambda and Beta

266
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,499
and generate a bunch of X's.

267
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:45,782
You can then make a histogram

268
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:48,847
and you've got yourself
a Weibull distribution.

269
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,260
One nice thing is to
look at different values

270
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,307
of Lambda and Beta and see
what the thing looks like.

271
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:57,198
It turns out that, if
Beta is less that one

272
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,216
or if Beta is greater than one,

273
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:02,550
the thing looks very
interesting in comparison.

274
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,996
I'm gonna do a quick bonus here.

275
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:06,822
I'm gonna walk us through
this very, very quickly

276
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:09,651
because it's already been a tough lesson,

277
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:12,780
but if you are really,
really stout of heart,

278
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,768
let's look at this bonus result.

279
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:16,808
And, I'm not really gonna
hold you responsible,

280
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:18,168
but I'd like you to see it.

281
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:20,432
In fact, if you don't wanna look at it,

282
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:22,028
go ahead, go to the summary,

283
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:25,362
but if you've got a couple
minutes, take a look.

284
00:11:25,362 --> 00:11:28,713
This is just another way to get the PDF

285
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:32,934
of Y equals H of X for some very nice,

286
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:34,893
continuous function of H.

287
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:36,774
This looks a little like LOTUS

288
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:38,744
and we'll be talking about
LOTUS on the next page.

289
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:40,349
So, here's another way to get the PDF

290
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:42,518
of capital Y equals H of X.

291
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:44,929
For continuous function, it avoids

292
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:48,597
getting a step or two.

293
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:50,343
It looks a little more complicated,

294
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,715
but, it turns out, it's kinda more direct.

295
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,475
I'll just step you
through this very quickly.

296
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:56,859
The CDF of Y is, by definition,

297
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:59,374
the probability that Y is
less than or equal to Y.

298
00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:02,274
I'm lazy, so I plug in Y equals H of X

299
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:05,003
and then I take the inverse of both sides.

300
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:07,729
If Y is nice and continuous,
I can take the inverse

301
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:09,931
and that gives me the probability that

302
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:12,791
X is less than or equal to H inverse of Y.

303
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,122
By the chain rule, and since the PDF

304
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:16,825
has to be greater than zero,

305
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:19,443
I take the derivative of
this thing, right there.

306
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:22,174
Little F of Y is the PDF of Y.

307
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,626
I take the derivative of the CDF and,

308
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:28,616
now, I use the chain rule;
X equals H inverse of Y.

309
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:30,907
Here's the derivative from the chain rule,

310
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:33,995
looking awful, but that's what it is.

311
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:35,699
The fact that the PDF is positive

312
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:38,192
means that I take the
absolute value of that term.

313
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:41,865
So, I'll use this result to prove LOTUS.

314
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:45,328
So, here's the expected value of Y,

315
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,596
remember, Y equals H of X,

316
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:52,380
that's what LOTUS is
the expected value of Y.

317
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,180
This equals, by definition,

318
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,900
so I haven't evoked LOTUS.

319
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,207
I'm gonna prove it here.

320
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:59,476
By definition, this is the integral over

321
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:02,639
the real line of Y times the PDF of Y.

322
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,412
That's this step right here.

323
00:13:04,412 --> 00:13:08,487
I plug in, using the chain rule,

324
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,393
an expression from the previous page,

325
00:13:10,393 --> 00:13:12,817
that awful mess from the last page.

326
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:14,077
That's what that mess is.

327
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:18,244
And, now, if you're willing to believe

328
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,107
that the absolute value
mess times the D of Y

329
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:28,657
is merely expressed as
D of H inverse of Y.

330
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:29,711
And, it kind of makes sense

331
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:33,251
because the DY's cancel
in the previous line.

332
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:36,779
And then, I set X equal to

333
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,616
H inverse of Y.

334
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:41,794
You get this result,
which is, in fact, LOTUS.

335
00:13:41,794 --> 00:13:44,052
Absolutley amazing!

336
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:45,827
Here's a summary of what we just did.

337
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:49,327
This is a long, difficult lesson,

338
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:50,994
but we got through it just fine.

339
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:55,170
We looked at distributions of
functions of random variables.

340
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,582
And, perhaps, the most
important thing for this class,

341
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:02,031
is that along the way we used
the Inverse Transform Theorem

342
00:14:02,031 --> 00:14:06,228
to turn uniforms, magically,
into arbitrary distributions.

343
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:08,132
We looked at the exponential and Weibull.

344
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:09,993
You give me a uniform, I'll give you

345
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:11,804
any distribution you want.

346
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:15,971
And this is extremely useful
in simulation all the time.

347
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,721
So, next time, if you
liked one random variable,

348
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:22,172
