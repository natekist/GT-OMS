1
00:00:02,411 --> 00:00:03,427
- Hi everyone!

2
00:00:03,427 --> 00:00:06,633
Well, now we're about to begin module two,

3
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:08,767
which is basically a series of boot camps

4
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:11,832
on calculus, probability, and statistics.

5
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:13,777
We're done with the easy stuff,
we've done a little tour,

6
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:15,213
now we're gonna get to do a little math,

7
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:18,370
but hopefully it's
mostly a review for you.

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,090
So here's the lesson overview for now.

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,109
In the last module I gave
a very high-level overview

10
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,934
of what simulation is, that was our tour,

11
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:30,155
and this time the module
is going to present

12
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,847
these various boot camps,
and I'm gonna start right now

13
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:34,603
with a calculus lesson.

14
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:36,433
Now here's the dirty little secret,

15
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:39,846
in fact there's nothing here
that you haven't taken before

16
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:41,240
if you've taken the prerequisites,

17
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,569
so don't worry too much,
just go with the flow

18
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:46,455
and let's see what we remember.

19
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:49,039
So we'll start our calculus primer now.

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,000
The goal here is just
to give a brief review

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,027
of these little tidbits
that we'll be using later on

22
00:00:55,027 --> 00:00:56,798
throughout the entire course.

23
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:59,117
First of all, let's go
through a couple sort of

24
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:01,060
elementary definitions
that you might remember

25
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,235
from long time ago.

26
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:05,222
Let's suppose that f of x is a function

27
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:09,477
that maps different values of
x from a domain to a range,

28
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:12,103
and you can represent
this thing in shorthand,

29
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:15,552
f goes from X to Y, you've
probably seen that before.

30
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:16,655
Here's an example.

31
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:19,322
If f of x equals x
squared, a little parabola,

32
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:23,321
then this function takes
x-values from the real line R,

33
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:24,663
that's some more notation,

34
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:27,813
and it maps it to the nonnegative
portion of the real line,

35
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:29,813
we'll call that R plus.

36
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:31,817
So let's do a little definition here.

37
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:35,592
We'll say that a function
f of x is continuous

38
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:38,931
if for any x naught and x in the domain

39
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:42,925
we have that the limit as x
goes to x naught of f of x

40
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:44,541
equals f of x naught.

41
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:48,651
Now that limit just
denotes the familiar limit

42
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:51,494
that we're all used to
even in high school,

43
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:55,308
and we'll assume that f
of x is going to exist

44
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:57,868
for all the x in the domain.

45
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,277
So here's a simple example.

46
00:01:59,277 --> 00:02:01,879
Let's let f of x equals three x squared,

47
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,788
now that's just a quadratic function,

48
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:06,548
that thing is obviously
continuous for all x.

49
00:02:06,548 --> 00:02:10,069
Now the function f of x equals integer x,

50
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:12,389
that's the round down function,

51
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,065
some people call it the floor function,

52
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:18,031
that thing's got what's
called a jump discontinuity

53
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:21,570
at any integer, so for
instance 3.4 equals three,

54
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,430
3.5 equals three, et cetera et cetera,

55
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,528
then it jumps up to
four when we get to 4.0.

56
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:29,699
Here's another definition,

57
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,667
we needed continuity for this one,

58
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:35,450
if f of x is continuous,
then the derivative,

59
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,223
which we denote as d dx f of x,

60
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:40,954
or sometimes we call it f prime of x,

61
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:44,379
that's the limit as h goes
to zero of the following:

62
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:47,629
f of x plus h, minus f of x, over h.

63
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:52,023
Now that can also be
interpreted as a slope

64
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:54,653
because f of x plus h minus f of x,

65
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:56,748
that's kinda the rise

66
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:59,500
and divided by h, that's the run,

67
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,417
over the range x to x plus h,

68
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:05,415
so that can be interpreted as a slope,

69
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:08,345
or an instantaneous slope at any point x.

70
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:09,981
Now we'll assume that it exists

71
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,449
and it's well-defined for any given x,

72
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:13,915
but that thing is the derivative.

73
00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:16,553
Here are some old friends.

74
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:19,425
So when you take the derivative
of a polynomial term,

75
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:23,226
x to the k, you may remember
that that derivative is

76
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:25,928
k times x to the k minus one.

77
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:27,105
If you don't remember,

78
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:30,783
go back to your calculus
book lickety split.

79
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:33,545
One nice derivative is e to the x,

80
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:35,829
e is that exponential constant

81
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:39,081
but e to the x, the derivative
of that stays the same,

82
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:40,724
e to the x.

83
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:42,303
It's kind of a neat property

84
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:47,201
but you can go back to your
calculus book and see why.

85
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:50,854
Sine of x, the derivative
of that is cosine of x,

86
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:52,876
and sort of complimentary to that,

87
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:56,248
cosine of x, the derivative
of that is minus sine of x,

88
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:58,997
that's just something
that you have to remember.

89
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:02,522
The natural log of x, the
derivative of that, is one over x,

90
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:05,727
we'll be using that in a
little while when we integrate.

91
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:08,047
And finally, this last old friend,

92
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,822
if for some reason you want the derivative

93
00:04:10,822 --> 00:04:14,806
of arctangent of x, well that's
one over one plus x squared,

94
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:16,337
and believe it or not we'll be using that

95
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:18,487
a couple times in the course.

96
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:21,122
So, here are some well known
properties of derivatives,

97
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:22,872
and I'll just using these on and off,

98
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,320
just wanted to remind you of them.

99
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,465
First of all, derivatives
have this linearity property.

100
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:31,075
The derivative of a times f of x plus b,

101
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:34,428
well that's just equal to a
times the derivative of x,

102
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:35,993
the derivative of b,

103
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:38,019
well that's the derivative of a constant,

104
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:39,956
and that's zero so that goes away.

105
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:42,865
If you've got the sum of two functions

106
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,446
then the derivative of the sum
is the sum of the derivative.

107
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:49,368
So f of x plus g of x,
the derivative of that,

108
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:52,698
is the derivative of f
plus the derivative of g.

109
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,361
Very nice.

110
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,446
Here's what's called the product rule,

111
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:57,988
the derivative of the product

112
00:04:57,988 --> 00:05:00,375
is this slightly complicated thing,

113
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:04,381
f prime of x times g,
plus f of x times g prime.

114
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:06,406
So that's just the product
rule, you have to remember it,

115
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:10,247
that'll be useful later on when
we do integration by parts.

116
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:11,792
Now we've got this quotient rule,

117
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:15,474
this is an interesting one,
the derivative of the quotient

118
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:17,722
is this mess on the right hand side,

119
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:20,925
so the derivative of f of x over g of x is

120
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:24,008
g times f prime minus f times g prime

121
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,791
over g squared.

122
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,532
That's a little bit hard to remember,

123
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:30,440
I'll go over a mnemonic in a second.

124
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,736
Finally, the chain rule, I'll
also give a reference on that,

125
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:38,924
that's the derivative of a
more complicated function.

126
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:43,091
So if we want the derivative
of f of another function g,

127
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:47,578
so we're kind of doing a
composition of functions,

128
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:50,801
the derivative of f of
g of x, that's equal to

129
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:54,843
the derivative of f evaluated
at g, now you take the inside,

130
00:05:54,843 --> 00:05:57,797
kind of do this in a chain, times g prime.

131
00:05:57,797 --> 00:06:01,964
So f g quantity prime equals
f prime of g times g prime.

132
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,588
It's kind of like a chain.

133
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:05,769
So here are a couple references,

134
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,833
the first one is a mnemonic
for the quotient rule.

135
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:13,111
So if you consider f of x
as Hi because it's on top,

136
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:16,128
it's in the numerator, and g of x as Ho,

137
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:18,926
cause it's in the denominator,

138
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:22,459
then the derivative of the
quotient can be expressed as

139
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,542
Ho dee Hi minus Hi dee Ho

140
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:27,957
over Ho Ho.

141
00:06:27,957 --> 00:06:30,738
Think about that, but it's
an easy way to remember it.

142
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:31,995
And then the chain rule,

143
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:34,801
there's a reference that you
can go look up on YouTube.

144
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,379
Here's an example, cause
you know we went through

145
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,494
all these equations, time
to do a little example,

146
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:39,921
here's an easy one I could think of,

147
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,300
let's let f of x equal x squared

148
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,346
and we'll set g of x
equal to natural log of x,

149
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:47,713
let's just see what some of
these things end up equaling

150
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:49,296
when we do these derivative rules.

151
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:52,001
First of all let's do the product rule,

152
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:55,088
so what's the derivative
of f of x times g of x?

153
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:59,782
Well remember, we said
that this is gonna be the

154
00:06:59,782 --> 00:07:04,327
f of x times g prime plus
f prime times g of x.

155
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,426
And let's see if that
turns out to be the case.

156
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,443
So the first equality is just a,

157
00:07:09,443 --> 00:07:12,264
I've reexpressed the
derivative of f times g

158
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:15,597
as the derivative of x squared
times natural log of x,

159
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:17,986
so according to my product rule it's,

160
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:20,885
well we'll do f prime of x times g,

161
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:24,549
so f prime is two x,
g is natural log of x,

162
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:28,359
plus f of x times g prime,
this looks a little tricky

163
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:30,193
because all of a sudden we just have an x,

164
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:31,721
but it actually makes sense.

165
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:33,437
What's g prime?

166
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:36,634
The derivative of natural
log of x is one over x,

167
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:39,762
and so that's cancels out
partially with the x squared

168
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:41,165
and that leaves me with the x

169
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:43,390
and so that's how we get
that answer, very very easy.

170
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,653
How about the quotient rule?

171
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:48,644
F of x over g of x, prime,
so that's the derivative

172
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:50,929
of x squared over natural log of x,

173
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:55,356
well you do Ho dee Hi
minus Hi dee Ho over Ho Ho,

174
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:57,656
Ho Ho in the denominator is very easy,

175
00:07:57,656 --> 00:08:00,291
that's just natural log
squared of x, that's easy.

176
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,708
So Ho dee Hi minus Hi dee Ho,

177
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:08,025
well let's do the dee Hi part first,

178
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:10,717
that's two x, Ho is natural log of x

179
00:08:10,717 --> 00:08:14,121
so that's where we get the left
hand side of that numerator,

180
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:15,288
and then minus

181
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,013
Hi dee Ho,

182
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:19,464
well we've already done that,

183
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:22,861
that's minus x, so that's
where that comes from.

184
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:26,184
Okay how about f of g quantity prime,

185
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:27,723
so we're gonna need the chain rule,

186
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,198
and that's gonna be

187
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:33,119
two times g of x times g prime of x,

188
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,179
and that turns out to equal

189
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,025
two times natural log of x over x.

190
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:41,112
Again you can go and check
that out, it's very very easy,

191
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:43,191
very very simple.

192
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:44,796
Okay let's make a remark now.

193
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:47,472
If one derivative is good enough,
how about two derivatives?

194
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:49,962
The second derivative,
f double prime of x,

195
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,673
equals the derivative
of the first derivative,

196
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:55,677
so I can express it as
d dx of f prime of x,

197
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:58,825
and you can kinda think of
it as the slope of the slope,

198
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:00,812
and if you remember physics class,

199
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:03,072
if f of x is what we'll call position,

200
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:06,216
then f prime of x is usually
regarded as velocity,

201
00:09:06,216 --> 00:09:09,473
and f double prime is acceleration,

202
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:11,977
so if we wanna be Isaac Newton,
we remember all this stuff.

203
00:09:11,977 --> 00:09:13,995
Knowing the second derivative is very nice

204
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:15,863
because it's helpful in finding mins

205
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:17,567
and maxes of a function.

206
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,014
So it turns out that the
minimum or maximum of f of x

207
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:24,660
can only occur when the
slope of f of x is zero,

208
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,608
think about it, kinda makes sense.

209
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,553
In other words, only when
f prime of x equals zero,

210
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:31,076
let's pretend for now that that happens

211
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:34,047
at the specific values x equals x naught,

212
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:37,626
then if f double prime of
x naught is less than zero,

213
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:39,352
it turns out you get a max.

214
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:41,857
If f double prime of x
naught is greater than zero,

215
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:46,533
you get a minimum, that's known
as concave down, concave up,

216
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:50,579
and if f double prime
of x naught equals zero

217
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:52,071
you get a point of inflection,

218
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,367
that doesn't happen very often

219
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:54,735
but when it does you get real sick

220
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:56,740
and that's why it's called
a point of infection.

221
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,561
I'm gonna go through this
example pretty quickly,

222
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:01,583
then we'll talk again in the
next lesson about this one.

223
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:05,092
Let's find x that minimizes f of x equals

224
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:08,139
e to the two x plus e to the minus x.

225
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,603
It turns out that the
minimum can only occur

226
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:12,468
when the derivative equals zero,

227
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:15,711
and I can take the derivative
of that using the chain rule,

228
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:19,019
the derivative of the
first term, e to the two x,

229
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,939
think of it as e to the g of x,

230
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:24,162
when I take the derivative of that,

231
00:10:24,162 --> 00:10:27,829
I get e to the g of x times g prime of x,

232
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:32,754
and so that gives me,
cause g prime is two,

233
00:10:32,754 --> 00:10:34,908
I get two e to the two x,

234
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:37,188
similarly the minus sign comes down

235
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:38,956
from the e to the minus x,

236
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:41,442
so the second term in the
derivative f prime of x

237
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:43,613
is gonna be minus e to the minus x.

238
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:45,179
Anyway, take all that,

239
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:48,147
two times e to the two x
minus e to the minus x,

240
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,736
set that equal to zero
and then solve for x.

241
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:54,297
So that solution occurs when x naught,

242
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:58,819
after a little algebra, equals
minus 1/3 natural log of 2,

243
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:02,086
and it turns out it's very easy to show,

244
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:03,976
if I take the second derivative

245
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:07,082
that f double prime of x is
greater than zero for all x,

246
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:10,787
and so therefore x naught is the minimum.

247
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:12,937
Okay, great, done with that example.

248
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:14,987
And in fact, done with this lesson.

249
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:16,263
Here's a summary.

250
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:19,069
What we did here is
that we did a little bit

251
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:21,754
of calculus derivative
memories, very nice stuff,

252
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:24,337
I hope there were no surprises.

253
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,343
And next time, I'm gonna take
sort of that last example

254
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:31,507
and I'm gonna give some
numerical techniques

255
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:33,950
to solve nonlinear equations,

256
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,263
in particular I'll try to
solve these nonlinear equations

257
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:39,889
to find out what the zeroes are,

258
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:41,285
and this is always pretty interesting

259
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,767
and it's actually stuff
that we'll be using

260
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:44,127
throughout the course.

261
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:45,960
So, see you next time!
