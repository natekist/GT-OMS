1
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:03,716
- Hi everybody.

2
00:00:03,716 --> 00:00:05,957
We're now going to continue in module two

3
00:00:05,957 --> 00:00:09,747
with integration as we go
through our calculus primer.

4
00:00:09,747 --> 00:00:11,736
Here is the lesson overview.

5
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:15,376
So, last time, we went through
a couple of different ways

6
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:17,837
to find zero of a complicated function.

7
00:00:17,837 --> 00:00:18,670
That was nice.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,517
We learned a couple of
ways that we'll be using

9
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:22,619
throughout the rest of the course.

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,517
Now, we'll kinda do what
goes up, must come down.

11
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:28,945
A couple lessons ago,
we reviewed derivatives,

12
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,667
now we're gonna go the other direction.

13
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,419
We're gonna do integration.

14
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:34,867
And again, this is the situation

15
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:38,288
where I hope that you'll
remember a lot of old friends.

16
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,637
Let's make the fundamental definition

17
00:00:40,637 --> 00:00:43,677
that a function, capital f of x,

18
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,098
having derivative, little f of x,

19
00:00:46,098 --> 00:00:48,387
is called the antiderivative.

20
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:51,737
The antiderivative is
denoted, capital f of x

21
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:53,067
equals the integral,

22
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:55,387
that little sign there
is the integral sign,

23
00:00:55,387 --> 00:01:00,068
of f of x, d x, and it's also
called the indefinite integral

24
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:01,608
of little f of x.

25
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:05,408
So, there's a couple ways that
you can say the notations.

26
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:07,645
This is the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

27
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:09,987
If little f of x is continuous,

28
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,728
then the area under the
curve, over the interval a, b

29
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,949
is denoted and given by what's
called the definite integral.

30
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:21,528
Integral from a to b of f, of x, d x

31
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:24,677
that's equal to, and this is notation,

32
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:28,746
capital f of x, the big straight up thingy

33
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:30,517
evaluate a and b.

34
00:01:30,517 --> 00:01:31,996
That's just the way you say it.

35
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:36,163
This is equal to capital f
of b minus capital f of a.

36
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:39,546
That's the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

37
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:43,713
This relates the derivative
of a function capital f of x

38
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:50,285
and it relates it to the
antiderivative little f of x.

39
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:52,576
So, everything's all nice
what you would expect.

40
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:54,426
The reason they call
it a definite integral,

41
00:01:54,426 --> 00:01:57,909
is because it's really,
really an integral.

42
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,618
Here are some old friends.

43
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:02,669
Just like we looked at the
friends of the derivatives,

44
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:05,277
here are the friends involving integrals.

45
00:02:05,277 --> 00:02:09,480
So, the indefinite integral
of x to the k power,

46
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,709
is x to the k, plus one
over k, plus one, plus c.

47
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,669
C is an arbitrary constant,

48
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,689
because you'll see that
when you take the derivative

49
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,669
of x to the k, plus one over k, plus one

50
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:22,170
that c, just becomes a zero.

51
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,170
So, I'm gonna have that c every place.

52
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,003
And I'll give you a little mnemonic

53
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:27,039
to remember that in a minute.

54
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,730
This particular integral holds
for all k not equal to one.

55
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,969
For k equal to negative one.

56
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:35,478
For k equal to negative one,

57
00:02:35,478 --> 00:02:39,170
we have to look at the special
case, integral of d x over x.

58
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,269
It turns out that's the natural log

59
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:43,787
of absolute value of x plus c.

60
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:46,889
We'll look at a mnemonic
for that in a little while.

61
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,558
The reason for this is

62
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:52,391
there's some convergence
and divergence issues

63
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:57,254
which only take place
when k equals minus one,

64
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:00,059
so let's just remember that.

65
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:03,061
Now, if the derivative
e to the x is e to the x

66
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:07,399
then the integral of e to the
x, d x is e to the x plus c.

67
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:11,869
Similarly, the integral of
cosine equals sine plus c.

68
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:12,702
Because, remember when we took

69
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:15,077
the derivative of sine we got cosine.

70
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:19,648
And the integral of one
over one plus x squared,

71
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:22,296
is equal to arctan plus c.

72
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:24,952
So, these are just, there's
a million of these things.

73
00:03:24,952 --> 00:03:27,810
I just gave a few that you might remember.

74
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,724
Here's an example.

75
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:30,583
And this is that mnemonic
I was talking about.

76
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,845
It's very easy to see from
the previous argument,

77
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:38,373
that since the integral
of d x over x is log of x,

78
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:42,315
then the integral of d cabin
over cabin, is log cabin.

79
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:43,925
Pretty funny math joke.

80
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,422
But, the reason I'm giving you this

81
00:03:45,422 --> 00:03:47,685
is because I want you
to remember that plus c,

82
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,973
the arbitrary constant.

83
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:53,104
And then we remember that log cabin plus c

84
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:54,613
is equal to houseboat.

85
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:57,576
So that's just something to keep in mind,

86
00:03:57,576 --> 00:03:59,935
and I'm sure you'll remember
that the rest of your lives.

87
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:00,768
Theorem.

88
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:02,106
Some well-know properties

89
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:03,936
of definite integrals are as follows.

90
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:07,795
The integral of f of x, d x from a to a,

91
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:10,324
so think of the area under this continuous

92
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:13,176
function under one point.

93
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,165
There is no area.

94
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:15,324
So, it's zero.

95
00:04:15,324 --> 00:04:16,947
The integral from a to b

96
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:20,203
is negative of the integral from b to a.

97
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:24,015
And finally, the integral from a to b

98
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:28,805
plus the integral, equals
the integral from a to c

99
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:30,955
plus the integral from c to b.

100
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:34,864
So, if you stop taking the
integral at some midpoint, c,

101
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:37,324
and then you start up again,

102
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:38,723
when you add those two pieces up

103
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:40,947
you just get the whole thing from a to b.

104
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,016
Here's some other properties
of general integrals.

105
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,755
The integral of the sum is
the sum of the integrals.

106
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:48,338
This is sort of the

107
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:52,555
analogous to the product
rule and derivatives.

108
00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:54,877
And this is called integration by parts.

109
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,294
Integral of f times g prime equals f of x

110
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,619
times g of x minus integral
of g times f prime.

111
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:05,459
That's called integration by parts.

112
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:08,259
'Cause we're breaking
things up into f and g.

113
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:12,437
And finally, this is sort of
reminiscent of the chain rule.

114
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,528
The integral of f of g of x times g prime

115
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:18,528
is equal to f of u, d u.

116
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,076
That's the substitution rule,

117
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:23,539
where we take u equal to g of x.

118
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,189
We got to be a little bit careful here,

119
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:29,917
because this substitution
of u of x equal to g of x

120
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:32,107
will possibly change the
limits of integration.

121
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:33,808
But it's something you should remember.

122
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:36,338
And here's a couple mnemonics
that will help you remember.

123
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:38,229
You can go look them up on the web.

124
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:39,739
Let's use integration by parts

125
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,709
with f of x equal to x

126
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:45,807
and g prime of x equal to e to the two x.

127
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:47,968
And then we'll also use
the chain rule, as well.

128
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:51,720
So, integral of x times e to the two x.

129
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,392
So, this thing

130
00:05:53,392 --> 00:05:57,419
you can see that I'm
associating x with f of x

131
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,155
and e to the two x with g prime of x.

132
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:02,757
When you use this integration by parts,

133
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:04,568
one of the tricks is just figuring out

134
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:05,808
what's the f of x part

135
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:07,509
what's the g prime of x part.

136
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,629
So, according to integration by parts,

137
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:12,748
the first term is gonna
be f of x times g of x,

138
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,299
which is f of x is x.

139
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:18,267
G of x, the integral of g prime

140
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,080
which is integral of e to the two x

141
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,899
is gonna be e to the two x over two.

142
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,851
I needed the chain rule for that.

143
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,200
So, that first term,

144
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,928
x times e to the two x over two

145
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:29,731
evaluate at zero and one.

146
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:33,549
And then subtract off g
of x times f prime of x.

147
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:36,240
And g of x is e to the two x over two,

148
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,758
f prime equals one.

149
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:38,789
And so what I have.

150
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,759
I do my substitution of zero and one

151
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,989
into that first term with
the big vertical thingy,

152
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:45,939
and then I subtract off the integral.

153
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,638
And I get e squared over
two after I substitute.

154
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:51,179
Now I do the integral.

155
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:54,148
That turns out to be minus
e to the two x over four,

156
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:56,289
evaluate at zero and one.

157
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:57,451
And there's my answer.

158
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,789
e to the two, e squared
plus one over four.

159
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:02,091
When the smoke clears.

160
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:03,296
A pretty easy example.

161
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:04,888
Let's give another definition.

162
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:07,884
Derivatives of arbitrary
order k can be written as

163
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:10,120
f, k in parentheses of x

164
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,240
or d k, d x k, f of x.

165
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,629
And by convention we let f not
just be the same as f of x.

166
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:19,808
So one nice thing, which we'll
use a couples times in class,

167
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:22,454
is that you can write f of x

168
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:24,966
in what's called a Taylor series expansion

169
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:28,747
about a point a and it's
given by this infinite sum,

170
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:31,197
sum from k equal to zero
of the k'th derivative

171
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:33,797
evaluated at a times x minus a

172
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:36,197
to the k'th power over k factorial.

173
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:38,379
That's what's called a
Taylor series expansion,

174
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:39,212
and it's quite nice.

175
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:40,557
It's used occasionally.

176
00:07:40,557 --> 00:07:42,848
Maclaurin series is just the Taylor series

177
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:46,037
expanded around a equals zero.

178
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:47,957
Now without going into huge detail

179
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:49,223
here are some Maclaurin friends.

180
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:50,743
You may remember this.

181
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:53,015
Sine of x, if I do all those derivatives

182
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,454
in the previous slide, can be
written as that infinite sum.

183
00:07:56,454 --> 00:07:57,701
The first one.

184
00:07:57,701 --> 00:07:59,895
Cosine of x, the second infinite sum,

185
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:01,602
and e to the x, is the third one.

186
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:02,614
They all look a little messy

187
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:03,653
but they're really not bad at all

188
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:06,713
and they're actually kind of famous.

189
00:08:06,713 --> 00:08:07,913
And while we're at it,

190
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:10,273
'cause I'm looking at all these sums.

191
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:12,783
Here are three that
have nothing to do with

192
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,564
these Taylor series, really,

193
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:16,573
but these are just things that come up

194
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:17,633
every once in a while.

195
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:20,653
So this is as good a place
as any to talk about 'em.

196
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:21,963
If I'm interested in adding up

197
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:24,575
all the values of k from one to n,

198
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,713
that's just n times n plus one over two.

199
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:30,062
This is something that
Gauss was able to do

200
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:33,703
when he was five or six
years old, believe it or not.

201
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:36,175
If I want to add up all
the values of k squared,

202
00:08:36,175 --> 00:08:39,073
you get n times n plus one,
times two n plus one, over six.

203
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:40,255
That's famous.

204
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:43,563
And if I have this
infinite geometric series,

205
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:47,925
I want to add up p to the k
from k equals zero infinity,

206
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:50,711
and turns out that that's
just one over one minus p.

207
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:51,687
And that's something
that you probably learned

208
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:55,358
in high school, but it bears repeating.

209
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:58,919
So one last thing we'll talk
about is L'Hospital's Rule.

210
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,109
Every once in a while we get into trouble

211
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:02,707
when we have something of the form

212
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:06,447
zero over zero or infinity over infinity.

213
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:09,177
So sometimes, L'Hospital's Rule's useful

214
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:10,829
because it turns out that zero over zero

215
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:12,890
or infinity over infinity,
they could equal anything.

216
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,957
So here's what it says,

217
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:17,090
if the limits f of x as x goes to a,

218
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,189
and g of x as x goes to a,

219
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:21,678
both go to zero or go to infinity,

220
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:24,170
then the limit of x goes to a,

221
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,869
a limit as x goes to a,

222
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:29,970
of f of x over g of x, equals the limit

223
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,137
as x goes to a of f prime
of x over g prime of x.

224
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,528
And it looks liked we're
complicating things

225
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:39,109
but sometimes this
rule, L'Hospital's Rule,

226
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:40,669
makes things a lot easier.

227
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:43,010
And this rule makes me
sick, ha ha ha, L'Hospital.

228
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,499
So here's a quick example.

229
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:47,141
And this characterizes
why this things so useful.

230
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:49,580
So let's look at sine of x over x.

231
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,341
Now as x goes to zero, this is
a zero over zero type thing.

232
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:55,450
So turns out, let's take the derivative.

233
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,399
Derivative of the top,
sine of x is cosine of x.

234
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,181
The derivative of the
bottom, x is equal to one.

235
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:04,567
So I can now take the
limit is x goes to zero

236
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,399
of cosine of x over one,

237
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,157
is gonna be cosine of zero
over one, which is one.

238
00:10:09,157 --> 00:10:10,829
So congratulations, you've just shown

239
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:13,101
sine of x over x goes to one.

240
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:14,748
Again you gotta be a little careful

241
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,798
because these zero over zero things

242
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:19,739
or infinity over infinity
can go to any quantity.

243
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:22,581
You've gotta be very careful about that.

244
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,981
Here's a summary of what we just did.

245
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:26,599
We've renewed acquaintances

246
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,409
with a bunch of old integral friends

247
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:30,547
and we looked at some
elementary properties,

248
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,847
including L'Hopsital's Rule.

249
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,650
Next time, I'm gonna look at

250
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,610
some numerical integration techniques

251
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,650
and I want to see what happens

252
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,650
when I can't do the integrals
in those nice, close form.

253
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,929
So what do we do if those friends

254
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:46,418
don't wanna come out and play with us?

255
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:49,335
And anyway, we'll see ya next time.
