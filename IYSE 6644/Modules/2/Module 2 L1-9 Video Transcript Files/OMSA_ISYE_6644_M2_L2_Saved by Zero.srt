1
00:00:02,257 --> 00:00:04,539
- In this lesson, I'm
going to be solving certain

2
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:07,396
nonlinear equations, looking for zeros

3
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:09,504
in all the wrong places.

4
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:12,360
So, here's the lesson overview.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,402
Last time, I talked about
certain calculus basics,

6
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:19,796
and right at the end, we
started looking for solutions

7
00:00:19,796 --> 00:00:23,674
to nonlinear equations, in
other words, finding a zero.

8
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:26,715
This time, I'm going to be
a little bit more formal

9
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:30,586
about ways that we can
conduct such a search.

10
00:00:30,586 --> 00:00:32,508
The material is going
to be used several times

11
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:35,151
in the course, take my word for this,

12
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:37,911
because it's actually
very, very important,

13
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:41,123
and is useful in a lot of
different methodologies

14
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:42,623
within simulation.

15
00:00:43,747 --> 00:00:47,226
So, finding zeros, how
might you find a zero

16
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:49,658
for some complicated linear function?

17
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:51,886
In other words, I'm
looking for the value of x,

18
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,558
such that f(x) = 0.

19
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:55,831
There's a couple ways:

20
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,965
trial and error, now
I've used this before,

21
00:00:57,965 --> 00:01:02,484
it is not so great, sort of a
search and destroy type thing.

22
00:01:02,484 --> 00:01:05,131
Bisection, this is actually better.

23
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,664
Here we're using a sort of
divide and conquer strategy,

24
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:13,305
where we at least narrow things
down every step of the way,

25
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:16,983
and Newton's method, or some
variation of Newton's method,

26
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:20,562
this is sort of a highly
dependable, very quick method,

27
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:23,372
and then, maybe later on in the course,

28
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:25,782
we may have time to look
at a fixed-point method,

29
00:01:25,782 --> 00:01:27,986
those are a little bit more
complicated and specialized,

30
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:30,548
but they're very nice as well.

31
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,020
So, here's an example that you may recall

32
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,557
from the last lesson, and
this example actually has

33
00:01:36,557 --> 00:01:39,787
an exact answer, at least
we can solve for it.

34
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:41,614
Nevertheless, I'm just going to remind us

35
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:46,362
of this example just for
stabilization purposes.

36
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:50,124
Let's find the value of x
that minimizes this function,

37
00:01:50,124 --> 00:01:52,541
e to the 2x plus e to the -x.

38
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:56,328
It turns out that this
minimum can only occur

39
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:58,441
when you take the derivative
and set it equal to zero,

40
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:01,641
so I took the derivative
using the chain rule,

41
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:05,615
and I got two times e to
the 2x, minus e to the -x,

42
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:07,613
set that equal to zero.

43
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:11,008
I'm going to make a little
algebra manipulation here,

44
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,096
and it turns out that the solution to this

45
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:18,009
is x naught equals
negative 1/3 log of two,

46
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:22,013
and that's approximately
equal to minus .231.

47
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:24,314
It turns out it's also easy to show

48
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:26,240
that the second derivative
is greater than zero

49
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,967
for all x, and so since that's
concave up at that point,

50
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:31,770
x naught is indeed a minimum.

51
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,915
So that's actually getting a real answer,

52
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:37,765
and the thing works,
it's possible to do that.

53
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:39,792
Now we'll look at the method of bisection.

54
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,990
Here, let's suppose that
I can find x values,

55
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,740
x1 and x2, such that the function

56
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:48,585
g(x1) is less than zero,

57
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,956
and g(x) value of x2,
is greater than zero.

58
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:54,581
I'm using g here instead
of f because I can use

59
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:56,979
any letter I want, and
I'll follow a similar logic

60
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:59,382
if the inequalities are reversed,

61
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:02,221
but let's just pretend that
g(x1) is less than zero,

62
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:04,584
g(x2) is greater than zero,
then by what's known as

63
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,656
the Intermediate Value Theorem,

64
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:08,664
which you may remember
from calculus class,

65
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:11,376
if one value of x gives
you a g(x) less than zero,

66
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:14,349
and one value of x gives you
a g(x) greater than zero,

67
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:16,895
that that means that there must be a zero

68
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,645
in between x1 and x2,

69
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:23,120
so x*, let's say that's the zero,

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,726
falls between x1 and x2, that's what

71
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:27,444
the Intermediate Value Theorem says,

72
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:29,851
at least if g(x) is continuous.

73
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:32,999
So what I'm going to do is,
I'm now going to kind of

74
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:33,983
split things in the middle.

75
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:38,064
Let's take x3 equal to x1 + x2 over two,

76
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:41,318
if g(x3) is less than zero,

77
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:45,500
then that means that there's
a zero between x3 and x2,

78
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,182
otherwise if g(x3) is greater than zero,

79
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:51,528
there must be a zero in x1 to x3.

80
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:54,814
That just follows again by the
Intermediate Value Theorem.

81
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:58,123
Either way, the length of
the search interval decreases

82
00:03:58,123 --> 00:04:01,130
by a factor of two, so what we'll do

83
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,123
is that we'll continue
in the same exact manner

84
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:05,721
until the length of the search interval

85
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:08,457
is as small as desired,
because every time we iterate

86
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,967
when we go to x4, x5, dot dot dot,

87
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,879
the length of the interval gets smaller

88
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,403
and smaller and smaller,
so let's try this out

89
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:19,927
for this function g(x)
equals x squared minus two.

90
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,182
Now, in fact, we know that
x equals square root of two

91
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:26,657
is a solution to this, so x
squared minus two equals zero,

92
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:30,080
that has a zero at x
equals square root of two,

93
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,929
so we know that, but by
doing this iteration,

94
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:35,315
which I'll show you on the next slide,

95
00:04:35,315 --> 00:04:38,754
we'll be able to approximate
square root of two.

96
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:41,765
Now, I'll illustrate the bisection method

97
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:44,375
on the function g(x)
equals x squared minus two,

98
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,379
and we already know that
the zero is going to be

99
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:48,066
x equals square root of two.

100
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:51,470
I have graciously graphed
out the function in Excel,

101
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,964
here it is right there, beautiful.

102
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:56,243
You can see just by looking at the thing

103
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:58,993
that the zero occurs right there,

104
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:04,453
and if you look carefully, it
occurs between 1.38 and 1.44,

105
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:06,809
which is not a surprise
because you and I know

106
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:10,032
that the square root of
two is 1.41 blah blah blah.

107
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:12,926
Let's just arbitrarily
pick a starting point,

108
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:15,832
x1 equals one, and x2 equals two,

109
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:19,999
so here's x1 equals one,
x2 equals two right there,

110
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:24,610
and you can see that the g of one value

111
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,836
and the g of two value
are negative and positive,

112
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:32,864
and so that means, since g(x1) is negative

113
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:36,195
and g(x2) is positive, that
means that there's a zero

114
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:39,380
between one and two, so my rules says

115
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,202
that I split the difference
between one and two,

116
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:45,971
I take the midpoint, so x3 is going to be

117
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,638
x1 plus x2 over two, that's 1.5,

118
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:51,997
and here's 1.5 on the graph.

119
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:55,376
You can see that we're
getting pretty close

120
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:56,209
to 1.414,

121
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,003
but g of 1.5 turns out to be

122
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:04,188
0.25, which is greater than zero,

123
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:07,127
and the implication is that the zero

124
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:11,339
is between one and 1.5,
so now I can continue

125
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,672
in this manner, dot dot dot.

126
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:17,338
I'll calculate x4 equals 1.25,

127
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:22,120
continuing, x5 equals 1.375,

128
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:25,871
and x6 equals 1.375,

129
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:28,549
and look at this, we
can really see quickly

130
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:31,463
that x* is starting to converge,

131
00:06:31,463 --> 00:06:35,213
it's converging to 1.414, kind of fast.

132
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:37,913
It's still taking its time
compared to Newton's method,

133
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:39,127
which I'll show you in a minute,

134
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:41,300
but it's doing a really good job.

135
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,660
So now, let's look at Newton's method.

136
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,054
So suppose somehow that I can
find a reasonable first guess

137
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:50,419
for the zero, say xi or x naught.

138
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:54,439
We'll start the iteration
at x, at i equals zero.

139
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,189
So, if g(x) has a very nice,
well-behaved derivative,

140
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:00,851
and by well-behaved I don't
want it to be too flat

141
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:03,418
near the zero, I'll show
you why in a minute,

142
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:07,445
then I'm going to
iterate my guess x sub i,

143
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:10,216
to xi plus one, as follows.

144
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:13,468
Xi plus one, my new guess for the zero,

145
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:14,635
is equal to xi

146
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,820
minus g(xi), divided by g prime of xi.

147
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,390
So, g(xi), if I'm close to my answer,

148
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,017
that's going to be approximately zero,

149
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:28,152
so I'm not going to be
moving my answer too much,

150
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:30,699
and depending on the derivative,

151
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,300
if the derivative is close to zero,

152
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,457
I may have to move things a lot.

153
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:36,124
If the derivative is

154
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:39,788
quite big or quite small,

155
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:43,966
or quite big negatively, I
won't be moving much at all.

156
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:46,089
But these two things taken together,

157
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:48,267
the g(x) and the g prime of x, show me

158
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,036
how much I'm going to be moving my guess.

159
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:53,847
Now, what I'll do if things go well,

160
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,684
believe it or not, is
I iterate xi plus one,

161
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,054
xi plus two, dot dot dot.

162
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:01,308
Things are gonna actually
converge, unless I've got

163
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:04,271
a couple crazy cases which I
won't talk about right now.

164
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:08,558
In fact, this makes sense
because if xi and xi plus one

165
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:12,854
are close to each other
and close to the zero, x*,

166
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:14,762
if you do a little bit of algebra,

167
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:17,257
you end up with g prime of x sub i,

168
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:21,673
approximately equal to g(x*) minus g(xi),

169
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:25,437
over x* minus xi, so that's
kind of the derivative

170
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:29,292
at point x sub i, so in
fact, if things go well,

171
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:32,687
this will converge fairly quickly.

172
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:34,467
Let's try Newton out for the same example

173
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:36,321
that we used for bisection,

174
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:39,219
namely g(x) equals x squared minus two,

175
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,176
and of course we secretly know
that the zero for this thing

176
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:46,412
is x equals square root of
two, which is about 1.414.

177
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:51,107
Notice that the iteration step
here is to set xi plus one

178
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:56,061
equal to xi minus g(xi)
over g prime of xi,

179
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:58,641
it's this thing right there, and g(xi)

180
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:01,197
is equal to xi squared minus two,

181
00:09:01,197 --> 00:09:05,353
g prime of xi, is equal
to 2xi, that's very easy.

182
00:09:05,353 --> 00:09:08,930
A little algebra gives
us that last expression,

183
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,784
xi over two, plus one
over xi, very very simple.

184
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:15,403
Let's start with this bad
guess of x1 equals one,

185
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:17,299
or x0 equals one, doesn't matter.

186
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:19,216
Here's what we have, x2

187
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:22,312
equals xi over two,

188
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:26,307
plus one over xi, and
xi is x1 in this case,

189
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:30,178
so x1 equals one, so that's one over two,

190
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:34,369
plus one over one, which is equal to 1.5.

191
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:37,286
Now, I plug 1.5 into this equation,

192
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:41,108
1.5 over two, plus one over 1.5,

193
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:43,717
now we get 1.4167.

194
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,441
Actually, it's a bunch of sixes,

195
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:48,587
but I rounded up to six seven.

196
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:50,837
Then finally, I plug 1.4167

197
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:54,358
into here and here,

198
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:58,525
and I end up with, on just
three or four iterations,

199
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:03,619
1.4142, amazing, very
close to the actual answer,

200
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:08,877
1.414 blah blah blah, and it
only took three iterations.

201
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:11,960
Absolutely fantastic, very very nice.

202
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:15,002
Here's a summary of what we just did.

203
00:10:15,002 --> 00:10:18,137
I went over some very easy,
basic techniques to solve

204
00:10:18,137 --> 00:10:21,672
certain nonlinear equations for zeros.

205
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:26,539
Next time I'll be doing the
battle of Leibniz versus Newton.

206
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,143
It's going to be integration
time, we're going to see

207
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:31,196
a lot of old friends from calculus class.

208
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:35,185
I hope everybody is looking
forward to that, because I am.

209
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:38,102
