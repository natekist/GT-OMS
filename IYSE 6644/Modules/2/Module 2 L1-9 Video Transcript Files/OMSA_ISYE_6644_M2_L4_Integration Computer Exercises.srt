1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,389
- Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:05,568
So now, we're gonna be moving

3
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:08,979
into some integration techniques

4
00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:11,519
when you can't get the
answer in closed form.

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,852
So, this lesson is entitled,

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,269
Integration Computer Exercises.

7
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:19,200
You'll see why.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,789
Here's the overview.

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,427
Last time I did this wonderful,

10
00:00:22,427 --> 00:00:24,829
puntastic integration review.

11
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:26,368
And you'll see for yourselves

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,287
when you go through that last lesson.

13
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:32,229
This time, I'm gonna implement several,

14
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,869
what are called, numerical techniques,

15
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:35,299
that you might need if you can't

16
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:37,952
get those beautiful printed
closed-form solutions

17
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:40,512
to a particular integral.

18
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:42,752
Which happens every once and awhile.

19
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,085
And one of these techniques

20
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,952
actually incorporates simulation.

21
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,955
I'm just gonna give you a
hint as to how that works

22
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:49,355
and we'll do that in gross

23
00:00:49,355 --> 00:00:52,005
and tedious detail a little bit later.

24
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:56,851
As an exercise, let's do
some very easy integration

25
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:59,414
via what I call Riemann sums.

26
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:00,613
And here what we're gonna do,

27
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:02,654
is we'll simply approximate the area

28
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:05,390
under this nice beautiful,
continuous function,

29
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,443
f of x from a to b,

30
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:11,350
just by adding up the areas
of n adjacent rectangles.

31
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,345
And you might remember from calculus class

32
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:16,298
that let's say these rectangles

33
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:19,814
evenly divide the
interval ab into n pieces,

34
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:21,385
so n as in Nancy.

35
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:24,343
And so, the width of each
rectangle is gonna be,

36
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:25,894
we'll call it delta x.

37
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:28,132
And that's just b minus a over n.

38
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:31,683
And the height of the
rectangle is f of xi,

39
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:35,163
where xi is one of the points
inside each of the rectangles.

40
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:37,454
So xi in this case could
be a lot of things.

41
00:01:37,454 --> 00:01:40,990
So, I'm gonna take it equal
to a plus i times delta x.

42
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,493
That's the right hand n
point of the ith rectangle.

43
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:47,442
So you can picture me writing
little adjacent rectangles

44
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:50,305
next to each other under the curve

45
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:53,713
and those rectangles are
approximately equal the curve.

46
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,872
So, the integral from a to b of f of x dx

47
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:58,493
is approximately equal to

48
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,842
the sum of the areas of the rectangles.

49
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:03,583
The height of the rectangle is f of xi

50
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,723
and the width of the rectangle is delta x.

51
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:10,745
So, what I've said now
is that as Riemann did,

52
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:12,835
I can approximate the integral

53
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:16,502
by this very simple
summation of rectangles.

54
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:20,704
And now to simplify things a little bit,

55
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:21,803
looks a little bit nastier,

56
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:23,802
but these are actual simplifications.

57
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:25,250
Delta x, I'm just taking the same

58
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,310
for each of the rectangles.

59
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,993
It's b minus a over n,

60
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:30,233
instead of having x of i,

61
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,073
I'm substituting a plus
i times b minus a over n.

62
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:35,305
That's x of i.

63
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:37,134
And the nice thing about this is,

64
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:42,043
as n goes to infinity for
nicely behaved functions,

65
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:44,213
the right hand side of this mess

66
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,065
equals the left hand side.

67
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,585
That's as n goes to infinity.

68
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,803
The rectangles get skinnier and skinnier

69
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,099
and they eventually approximate the area

70
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,123
under the curve really well.

71
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:55,854
We've sorta seen that in
some of the demos I've given.

72
00:02:55,854 --> 00:03:00,094
So, let's try this out on the
integral from zero to one.

73
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:02,532
A sign of pi x over 2dx.

74
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:04,092
We've sorta seen this before.

75
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:06,094
It's secretly equals two over pi,

76
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:07,427
which is 0.6366.

77
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:12,694
And I'm gonna do this for
different values of n.

78
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,203
Actually, I'll write down for one

79
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:16,083
and then you can see for
yourself for other values.

80
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,174
Okay, here we go.

81
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:18,418
Since I'm a very nice guy

82
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:20,619
I'm gonna try to make
things as easy as possible.

83
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:23,673
And I'm gonna take a equals
zero and b equals one.

84
00:03:23,673 --> 00:03:25,323
And that just simplifies things.

85
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:29,327
So instead of writing delta
x equals b minus a over n,

86
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:31,241
b is one, a is zero,

87
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,539
then delta x is just one over n.

88
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,529
And xi is i over n.

89
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:36,763
So this simplifies things.

90
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:41,080
So what we have is, integral
from a to b, f of x dx,

91
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,165
just equals, like I promised,
integral from zero to one

92
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:45,323
of f of x.

93
00:03:45,323 --> 00:03:49,119
And that approximately
equals, by that 2nd equation

94
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:52,825
on the previous page,
summation f of xi delta x.

95
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:57,526
Delta x is b minus a over n,
which is one minus zero over n,

96
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:58,999
so that's where we get the one over n.

97
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:03,166
F of xi, well f of x is
sine of pi, x over two.

98
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:09,631
So you can see how I've got
the sine of pi over two,

99
00:04:09,631 --> 00:04:11,999
and the x is just i over n.

100
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:16,180
So let's take n equals 100,
get Excel or whatever out,

101
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,367
don't do it by hand,
'cause there's 100 of 'em.

102
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:21,997
This calculates out to a value of .6416,

103
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:24,397
which is actually pretty
close to that true answer

104
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:28,403
of two over pi, which
is approximately .6366.

105
00:04:28,403 --> 00:04:31,929
If I made n bigger, I'm gonna
get closer to that answer.

106
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:33,721
And maybe you can try that out at home.

107
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:35,111
Here's another computer exercise.

108
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,869
This is the trapezoid version.

109
00:04:36,869 --> 00:04:38,221
Now we're gonna do

110
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:41,221
the same type of numerical
integration problem,

111
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:43,379
except now I'm using the trapezoid rule,

112
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:44,690
which is usually a little bit better

113
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,811
than this Riemann summation.

114
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:51,231
Now we have integral
from a to b of f of x dx,

115
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:53,702
that equals this more
complicated function.

116
00:04:53,702 --> 00:04:55,887
In the middle there,
there's still this summation

117
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,368
from i equals one to n minus one,

118
00:04:58,368 --> 00:05:01,634
so the sum now instead of
going from i equals zero to n,

119
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,415
goes from i equals one to
n minus one of f of xi.

120
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:07,701
But now we have these end
points f of x naught over two,

121
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:10,707
f of xn over two, and so it turns out

122
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:11,591
if you draw the little picture,

123
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:14,008
instead of having rectangles,

124
00:05:15,203 --> 00:05:17,609
you have sort of little trapezoids now.

125
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:21,495
This mess simplifies
down to the next line,

126
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:25,682
b minus a over n, times the
giant thing in brackets.

127
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:27,128
And I'm not gonna have you

128
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:29,285
actually go through an example right now.

129
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:31,496
You might wanna try this out at home

130
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:35,084
on the same integral, zero to
one, sine of pi x over two.

131
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,860
You'll get pretty much the same answer,

132
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,449
except it turns out you
get a little bit faster

133
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:43,377
for a smaller values of
n converge the answer

134
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,093
two over pi a little bit more quickly.

135
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:46,861
You can try this out yourself.

136
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:48,070
It's not that hard.

137
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,214
Okay now, the thing that
interests me the most,

138
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:53,035
and in fact this is a simulation class,

139
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:55,493
we're gonna learn in more detail

140
00:05:55,493 --> 00:05:57,989
a Monte Carlo simulation method

141
00:05:57,989 --> 00:06:00,925
to accomplish the same
approximate integration.

142
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:04,021
So I'm gonna have you just
take my word for it for now,

143
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:06,529
but we'll get into this
in more detail later on.

144
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:08,174
I just wanna show you what
we're dealing with here.

145
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:12,978
Let's suppose that I can
generate a series of independent,

146
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:14,990
identically distributed random numbers,

147
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,333
uniform random numbers
between zero and one.

148
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,725
If you don't remember
what a uniform number is

149
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:20,558
between zero and one,

150
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:23,427
it's just a random real
number between zero and one.

151
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:27,594
You can use Excel, the
function RAND, what a surprise.

152
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:30,409
How do we use these random numbers

153
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:33,243
between zero and one to
approximate the integral?

154
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:36,001
It turns out that with
just a little bit of work,

155
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:38,468
and we'll go through this
in tedious detail later on,

156
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:40,950
the integral from a to b of f of x dx

157
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,658
is approximately equal
to b minus a over n,

158
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:44,865
that looks familiar.

159
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:47,503
Times the summation from x equals one to n

160
00:06:47,503 --> 00:06:50,336
of f of a plus b minus a use of i.

161
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:54,370
This looks a lot like the Riemann integral

162
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,618
except what's going on

163
00:06:55,618 --> 00:06:57,438
is that these are not gonna be rectangles

164
00:06:57,438 --> 00:06:58,814
that are right next to each other.

165
00:06:58,814 --> 00:07:01,273
These are gonna be rectangles
that are randomly placed

166
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:02,935
between a and b.

167
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:04,732
Take my word for it for now.

168
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:09,319
And it turns out, this converges
at about the same speed

169
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,426
as Riemann, to the correct answer,

170
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:13,364
namely integral from a to b of f of x.

171
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:16,016
And if you want, you can
go home and try this out

172
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:17,965
on the same integral that
we've been working with

173
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:22,346
but you'll be given adequate
practice with this later on.

174
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:24,114
Here's a summary.

175
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:25,220
This time we went over

176
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,583
some very easy numerical
integration techniques.

177
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,219
And right at the end I
snuck in a little simulation

178
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:34,200
while you weren't looking,
we snuck it in there.

179
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,386
Next time I'm just gonna make a guess

180
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:38,387
that it's very, very likely

181
00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:41,184
that we're gonna be starting
our probability primer.

182
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:43,431
You might say it's probable.

183
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:45,181
So we'll see ya then.
