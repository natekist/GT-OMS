1
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,050
- Hi everyone,

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,415
so we're still continuing
the probability boot camp.

3
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:09,533
And in this lesson, we'll be talking about

4
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,615
jointly distributed random variables

5
00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:14,118
because one is just never enough.

6
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:16,295
Here's our lesson overview,

7
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:18,589
in the last lesson we looked at

8
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:20,045
functions of random variables,

9
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:23,739
and in particular, we looked
at the inverse transform method

10
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,276
for generating random
variable from uniforms,

11
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:30,092
which has tremendous
implications in simulation.

12
00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:30,925
In this lesson,

13
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:33,315
we'll look at two
dimensional random variables

14
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:35,547
that may or may not be
correlated with each other.

15
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:38,906
Think about height and
weight, for instance.

16
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:43,171
And in simulation, I think
about things like consecutive,

17
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:45,059
correlated waiting times.

18
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,974
So if we have customers
in a line, obviously,

19
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:51,477
the waiting times between
customers are going to be

20
00:00:51,477 --> 00:00:53,653
correlated with each other.

21
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:54,701
So here's the idea,

22
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,726
let's consider two
random variables for now,

23
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:59,542
interacting together, let's
think height and weight.

24
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:03,709
So let's look at the definition
of the joint cdf of X and Y,

25
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:07,123
two random variables, so that's capital

26
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:10,859
F of (x, y), capital F for the cdf,

27
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:13,831
that equals the probability that X

28
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:15,602
is less than or equal to little x,

29
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:19,381
Y is less than or equal
to little y, jointly.

30
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:21,035
We're looking at the two random variables,

31
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:22,426
x and y, simultaneously.

32
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:26,276
Here's the remark then,
the marginal cdf of X is

33
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:28,609
the cdf of X just by itself,

34
00:01:29,527 --> 00:01:31,789
so marginal means, just by itself.

35
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:34,291
So you can think of F of
(x) as the probability that

36
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,909
X is less than or equal to little x, well,

37
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,776
if I let Y equal to infinity,

38
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:40,995
in the joint cdf definition,

39
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:44,095
that's the probability that
X is less than or equal to

40
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:46,963
little x, Y is less than
or equal to infinity.

41
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:49,716
So that's the same thing
as X all by itself.

42
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:51,997
I'm using the subscript
capital X to remind us

43
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:53,765
it's just X all by itself.

44
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:57,261
Similarly, the marginal
cdf of Y all by itself,

45
00:01:57,261 --> 00:02:01,467
capital F of subscript
y, that's the joint cdf

46
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:04,854
evaluated, X equals
infinity, and little y.

47
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:08,127
Another definition now,
if capital X and capital Y

48
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,702
are discrete random variables,

49
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:14,624
then the joint pmf probability
mass function of X and Y

50
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:18,790
is little F of (x) equals
the probability that

51
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,779
capital X equals little x,
capital Y equals little y.

52
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:26,135
So, that completely defines
the joint probability

53
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:27,403
mass function of X and Y.

54
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:30,475
In fact, if you add up all
those possible F of (x)

55
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:32,795
y values, you'll get one.

56
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:34,714
Just as before, for the cdf

57
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:38,357
we can calculate the marginal pmf of x,

58
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:41,268
and that's just the
pmf of x all by itself,

59
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:43,970
little F of (x) equals
the probability that

60
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,682
capital X equals little x.

61
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:48,633
And by, you may remember the
law of total probability,

62
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:51,778
the way you get that is
you take the joint pmf,

63
00:02:51,778 --> 00:02:55,523
and just add up all the possible y values.

64
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,754
For all the y's, you add
them up, you get f of (x).

65
00:02:57,754 --> 00:03:01,921
Similarly, the marginal pmf
of Y, Fy is the probability

66
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:04,564
that Y equals little y,

67
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:08,731
that's just the sum over all
x values of the joint pmf.

68
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:15,253
So you fix y, and add up
all the possible x values,

69
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:17,827
and you get the probability
that Y equals little y.

70
00:03:17,827 --> 00:03:19,033
Now, you'll see what I'm talking about

71
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,150
when we do a numerical example.

72
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,139
This table gives the joint
probability mass function,

73
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:27,768
f of (x, y), for a little,
simple example that I thought of.

74
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:28,844
Very simple.

75
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:32,388
And we have the possible values of X are

76
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:34,114
two, three, and four.

77
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,547
Right here.

78
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:37,609
The possible values of Y are four and six,

79
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:39,590
I just made these up.

80
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,572
The numbers in the interior of the table

81
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:43,699
give the joint pmfs.

82
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,188
So for instance,

83
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:48,697
the probability that X
equals two and Y equals for

84
00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:51,793
is point three, same with
the other five entries.

85
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:55,870
They add up, these
interior entries, to one.

86
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,419
You add them all up, you get one.

87
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,047
Now, here's why we call little f of (x),

88
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:03,565
little f of (y), marginals.

89
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:04,398
So here's little f of (x)

90
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:07,023
and it's called the marginal
probability mass function

91
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:11,916
because if I were to take
all the y values for say,

92
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,248
x equals two,

93
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:14,532
add them up,

94
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:17,349
I get point three, plus point one,

95
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:19,004
equals point four.

96
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:22,284
That corresponds to the
probability that x equals two.

97
00:04:22,284 --> 00:04:25,108
So I added up all the y
values when x equals two

98
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:27,868
and I got the marginal value,

99
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,448
probability that x equals two.

100
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:32,053
And turns out, it was point four.

101
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:35,584
Similarly, I get x equals
three, x equals four,

102
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:38,056
and so that completely defines the

103
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:41,551
probability mass function for x,

104
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:44,041
and namely, it's point four,
point four, and point two,

105
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,102
for x equals two, three,
and four, respectively.

106
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:47,655
And that adds up to one,

107
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,860
because it's a probability mass function.

108
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,151
Same thing with y,

109
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:53,782
the probability that y
equals four, is point six,

110
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:55,927
the probability that y
equals six, is point four,

111
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:58,238
I just added up all the
x values along the row.

112
00:04:58,238 --> 00:04:59,543
So very, very nice.

113
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:02,217
Here's the continuous
version of these definitions.

114
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,192
If X and Y are continuous,

115
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:06,268
then the joint pdf,

116
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:07,921
probability density function,

117
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:09,504
of X and Y,

118
00:05:09,504 --> 00:05:11,664
is given by this nasty looking thing,

119
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:15,831
little f of (x, y) equals
the second partial derivative

120
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:19,845
of capital F of (x, y).

121
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:21,192
So just take my word for that

122
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:24,032
and note that if I take
the double integral of

123
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,459
f of (x, y), dxdy, that equals one,

124
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,082
that corresponds to adding
up in two dimensions

125
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:31,914
all the x and y probabilities
in the discrete case.

126
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,124
I can get the marginals of X and Y.

127
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:38,410
The marginal pdf of X is
given by f of (x) equals

128
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,258
the integral, over all
values of y of f of (x, y),

129
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:47,425
that corresponds to adding
up, in the discrete case,

130
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,198
all the f of (x, y)
values, over all the y's,

131
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:55,615
to get the marginal pmf of x.

132
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,960
So here's the marginal pdf
of x that's just the integral

133
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,130
over all y of f of (x, y).

134
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,049
The marginal pdf of y,
similarly, is integral of

135
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:09,216
x of f of (x, y), dx.

136
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:12,304
So I'm integrating out the x's,

137
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:15,034
and I'm just left with
the function of the y's.

138
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:15,867
Here's an example,

139
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:17,800
and I'll be using this
example for a while.

140
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,005
Let's suppose that the
joint pdf is given by

141
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:24,681
f of (x, y) equals 21
over four, x squared, y.

142
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:29,396
And this is for all y values
between x squared and one.

143
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:31,107
This is a legitimate pdf,

144
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:34,230
if I take the double integral
over all the (x, y) values

145
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,231
satisfying x squared less
than y less than one,

146
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,862
this thing does, in
fact, integrate to one.

147
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:42,287
It's a little bit tricky,

148
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:43,300
because of these limits,

149
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,573
the limits are x squared,
less than y, less than one.

150
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,013
I call these funny limits,

151
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:51,052
I'll be using that
expression occasionally.

152
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:53,319
Funny, as in strange, not ha-ha.

153
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,916
So this is the joint pdf,

154
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,193
the darn thing does integrate to one.

155
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:58,039
Here's the marginal.

156
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,165
Marginal of x is given by

157
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:04,186
integral over all values
of y of f (x, y) and

158
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:06,337
here's where we have
to be a little careful,

159
00:07:06,337 --> 00:07:09,739
the limits of y are from x squared to one.

160
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:12,418
So let's slavishly plug that in.

161
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:16,049
Integral from x squared
to one of f of (x, y) is

162
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:18,532
21 over four, x squared, y.

163
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:20,435
After the smoke clears,

164
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:23,052
you get 21 over eight, x squared,

165
00:07:23,052 --> 00:07:24,684
times 1 minus x to the fourth.

166
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:28,477
Now, that is for x between
negative one and one.

167
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,090
Where did the y go?

168
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,364
Well I integrated it out, it's gone.

169
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,347
So, after I get rid of the y,

170
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:37,335
I'm just left with the limits of x squared

171
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:38,933
having to be less than one,

172
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:40,813
and that's the same thing as negative one

173
00:07:40,813 --> 00:07:41,706
less than x, less than one.

174
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:42,683
That's how I got that.

175
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:44,565
The marginal for y, similarly,

176
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:48,437
f of (y) equals integral
of f of (x, y), dx.

177
00:07:48,437 --> 00:07:52,395
Now, if x squared is less
than y, is less than one,

178
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:54,735
well, that means that x squared

179
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,410
runs from negative square root of y

180
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,601
to plus square root of y.

181
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:58,620
It looks a little bit tricky,

182
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,747
but that's what it is.

183
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,580
And after the smoke clears there,

184
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,747
I'm left with 7 halves, y to the 5 halves.

185
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:07,291
And there are no x's anymore

186
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,818
because this is the marginal y's and

187
00:08:08,818 --> 00:08:10,293
I've integrated the x's out.

188
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:14,123
That just means that y
is between zero and one.

189
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,582
Because I got rid of all
of the x's in my limits.

190
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,387
That's where I get zero
less than y, less than one.

191
00:08:18,387 --> 00:08:19,835
The nice thing is,

192
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:23,715
I can integrate this pdf,
7 halves y to the 5 halves,

193
00:08:23,715 --> 00:08:25,682
in my head between zero and one,

194
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:28,669
and the darn thing integrates
to one, just like I promise.

195
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,283
It's a legitimate pdf.

196
00:08:30,283 --> 00:08:31,273
Here's the definition.

197
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:33,535
X and Y are independent
random variables if

198
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:38,290
f of (x, y) equals f of (x)
times f of (y) for all x and y.

199
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,070
This corresponds to the same
definition of independence

200
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,779
we had way, way long ago
when we started our review.

201
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:45,997
Here's the theorem,

202
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:48,972
X and Y are independent if
you can write their joint pdf

203
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:51,754
as a function of x times a function of y.

204
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:53,541
I'm calling that a(x) times b(y).

205
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,533
Just for any old a(x) and b(y).

206
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:57,885
This is all fine and good,

207
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:01,635
but sometimes it looks
like you can write it as

208
00:09:01,635 --> 00:09:03,034
a of (x) times b of (y),

209
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:05,493
but if the darn thing has funny limits,

210
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:07,412
that's why I keep on
saying the darn thing,

211
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:09,580
then these guys are not independent.

212
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,827
So if you can write it as
a of (x) times b of (y),

213
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:12,817
that's great,

214
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:15,122
but don't forget the funny
limits if they're there.

215
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,844
And I'll give examples in a
second, to show you what I mean.

216
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:20,362
So, funny limits cause a lot of trouble.

217
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:22,757
In the previous example that I did,

218
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:24,020
again, I'll show you that in a minute,

219
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,468
we had funny limits.

220
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:27,171
So, here are a bunch of examples.

221
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:29,268
Let's let f of (x, y) equal cxy,

222
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,372
for zero less than x, less than two,

223
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:33,468
zero less than y, less than three.

224
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:36,256
What's nice here is that, look at that,

225
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:40,123
a(x) times b(y), very
simple, no funny limits.

226
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:43,011
These guys are independent,
that's an easy one.

227
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:44,694
How about this? This is
our previous example,

228
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:46,839
from a couple pages ago.

229
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,648
Look at that, I can write a(x) times b(y),

230
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:51,646
but hold on, funny limits.

231
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:55,669
So that means that x and y
are not independent, too bad.

232
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:56,902
And finally,

233
00:09:56,902 --> 00:10:00,988
here's f of (x, y) equals c over x plus y.

234
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:02,051
The reason I say c,

235
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:03,285
is because I'm too lazy
to figure out what the

236
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:05,559
appropriate consonant is gonna be.

237
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,111
C over x plus y, that you
cannot write as a function

238
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:11,248
of a(x) times b(y), so too bad,

239
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:12,560
they're not independent.

240
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,829
Notice that I didn't
have funny limits here,

241
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:16,790
but so what, I couldn't
write that as a function

242
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,621
of a(x) times b(y) so, not independent.

243
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:20,990
Too bad.

244
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,524
Let's give another definition,

245
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:24,549
the conditional probability
density function or

246
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:28,376
probability mass function of
Y, given X equals little x,

247
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:31,045
is just like, when we
were doing the initial

248
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:32,677
probability review,

249
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:35,324
it's f of (x, y) over f of (x),

250
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:37,647
and that assumes that
x is greater than zero.

251
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:39,937
This is a legitimate probability mass or

252
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:41,321
probability density function.

253
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:42,668
For instance, in the continuous case,

254
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:45,784
the thing integrates to one,
just like it's supposed to.

255
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:48,352
So if I integrate over all values of y,

256
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:51,447
that will integrate to
one for any given x.

257
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:54,427
And I'll motivate that a
little more in a second.

258
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:58,035
Here's an example, if f of
(x, y) equals our old friend,

259
00:10:58,035 --> 00:10:59,311
21 over four, x squared, y,

260
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:01,636
for x squared less than y, less than one,

261
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:05,285
then f of (y) given x, is, by definition,

262
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:08,087
f of (x, y) over f of (x),

263
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:11,005
I plug and chug all this mess here,

264
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:14,336
this is 21 over four, x squared,
y, that's my f of (x, y),

265
00:11:14,336 --> 00:11:18,828
here's f of (x), which we
calculated a couple pages ago.

266
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:21,993
I do the algebra, and here's my answer.

267
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:24,868
Two, y, over one minus x to the fourth.

268
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:28,105
And this is for y between
x squared, and one.

269
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:31,706
I did nothing to get rid of the x value,

270
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:34,581
I mean, those x's are
there because I told you,

271
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:36,205
I've got this information about x,

272
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:38,503
so of course it should be included in the

273
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:39,964
conditional pdf.

274
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:42,694
These conditional distributions
are very, very important.

275
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:45,405
If X and Y are independent,
then it turns out that

276
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:50,118
f of (y), given x, equals f
of (y) for all of x and y.

277
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:54,012
So what this means, is
that information about x,

278
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:57,206
contributes nothing to
the distribution of y.

279
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:59,253
So this might be one of these cases where,

280
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:02,003
what's the IBM stock price today,

281
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:07,695
given the fact that it's
thirty degrees on Mars?

282
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:10,548
Well, the information
x equals 30 degrees has

283
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:13,528
no impact, at all, on the IBM stock price.

284
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:15,611
Or is that what we're told to believe.

285
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:16,703
So here's a quick proof.

286
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,142
F of (y), given x

287
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:19,096
equals, by definition,

288
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:21,999
f of (x, y) over f of (x).

289
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:25,558
Now, if x and y are
independent, then f of (x, y)

290
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:28,032
equals f of (x) times f of (y),

291
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:29,630
by definition of independence.

292
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,689
And then, the f of (x)'s
on top and bottom cancel,

293
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:33,759
and I'm done.

294
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,813
So that's the end of
the proof, very simple.

295
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:38,008
This is gonna lead me
now to the conditional

296
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:41,319
expectation of Y given X equals little x.

297
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:43,871
If you're willing to
believe that I can give you

298
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:46,283
the conditional pdf or pmf of Y given X,

299
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:50,280
then I can take the expected
value of that updated

300
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,421
information of Y.

301
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:53,677
And again, I'll motivate in a second.

302
00:12:53,677 --> 00:12:54,774
Here's the definition,

303
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,941
the conditional expectation
of Y given X equals little x

304
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,832
is in the discrete case,

305
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:06,767
summation of y times f of (y) given x,

306
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:09,628
in the continuous case, integral,

307
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:13,821
of y times f of (y) given
x, and that's taken over dy.

308
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:17,654
X is fixed, and we
integrate, or sum, the y's.

309
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:22,541
Now, this is a very,
very important concept.

310
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,446
Because what it allows
us to do is to update

311
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:27,098
our information about y,

312
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,094
after we've heard about x.

313
00:13:30,094 --> 00:13:31,997
So for example, let's suppose

314
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:34,244
I've got a guy in the room
and he's seven feet tall,

315
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:36,284
and I'm interested in his expected weight.

316
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:38,907
The information that he's seven feet tall,

317
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:42,927
is going to give me an
expected value for his weight,

318
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:45,925
an expected value of y,
given that x equals seven.

319
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,156
That's probably going
to be greater than the

320
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:51,087
expected weight of some
totally random guy,

321
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:53,148
with no information about his height.

322
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:54,687
Now, that would be the
expected value of y,

323
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:58,438
that's total, random
guy from the population,

324
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,556
no knowledge at all about his height,

325
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:03,886
that's going to give me a
different expected value

326
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:07,943
for weight, than somebody
who's height I already know.

327
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:09,869
Here's our old continuous example,

328
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:11,574
that we've seen nine
thousand times already.

329
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:14,597
Let's let f of (x, y) equal 21 over four,

330
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:17,135
x squared, y, x squared
less than y, less than one.

331
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:19,882
Here's the conditional expected value,

332
00:14:19,882 --> 00:14:23,352
by definition, it equals the
integral over the real line

333
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:25,520
of y times f of (y) given x.

334
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,656
I plug in f of (y) given x,
that's two y squared over

335
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:32,503
one minus x to the fourth times y.

336
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:34,364
I integrate y between x squared and one,

337
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:37,758
and after the algebra, here's my answer.

338
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:40,163
Two-thirds, one minus x to the sixth over

339
00:14:40,163 --> 00:14:41,678
1 minus x to the fourth.

340
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:44,215
And this is actually for x
between negative one and one.

341
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:46,890
Notice it's perfectly
okay to have an x here,

342
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,935
because in fact, the
expected value of y is

343
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:51,275
a function of little x.

344
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:54,199
The expected weight is a
function of the height.

345
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,525
So it's perfectly okay to have

346
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:58,864
that nasty looking expression.

347
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,458
So here's a summary of what
we just did in this lesson.

348
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,710
We did a lot of stuff with
joint pmf's and pdf's,

349
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,170
we looked at independents,

350
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,367
we looked at conditional distributions,

351
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,550
we even looked at conditional expectation,

352
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,396
that's a lot of stuff.

353
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:17,241
Next time, I'm gonna continue the fun,

354
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:19,103
with conditional expectation,

355
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:21,583
including something I call double trouble.

356
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,488
This is by far the hardest lesson

357
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,384
that we'll do in the boot camp.

358
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:28,815
I want you to see it, I'm
not gonna have you repeat it

359
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:31,088
verbatim ever, but I
do want you to see it.

360
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:33,264
So really looking forward to next time,

361
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:35,514
it's gonna be a lot of fun.
