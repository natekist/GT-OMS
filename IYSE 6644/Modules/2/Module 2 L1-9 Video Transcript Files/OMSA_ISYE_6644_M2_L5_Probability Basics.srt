00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:03,653
- Hi everyone.

2
00:00:03,653 --> 00:00:05,707
So now we're finally
gonna start our review

3
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:08,668
on some Probability basics, and again,

4
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:11,009
if you've had these for
requisites that's just great,

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,342
if not, have some fun and sort of recall

6
00:00:15,545 --> 00:00:17,208
maybe what you might've seen

7
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,738
for the first time way back

8
00:00:18,738 --> 00:00:21,981
even in high school if you
took an AP Stats class.

9
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,459
So here's the lesson overview.

10
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:28,220
In the previous lesson we
completed our Calculus Primer,

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,783
did a little bit of numerical integration.

12
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:34,480
This time I'm gonna start
a review of Probability

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,730
with some very easy basics,

14
00:00:37,644 --> 00:00:40,989
and if you're a tyro,
which means beginner,

15
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:43,620
feel free to peruse, take a look at,

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,752
the notes at your leisure,

17
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:46,325
but you know, pay
attention to the material

18
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:48,993
that you don't happen to remember so well.

19
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:50,097
So here are the basics.

20
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:52,712
I'm gonna assume that you know
about the real, real basics

21
00:00:52,712 --> 00:00:54,321
like sample spaces, events,

22
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,395
and even the definition of probability,

23
00:00:56,395 --> 00:00:58,269
so if somebody tells you

24
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:00,362
well I think that this thing happens

25
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:02,038
with a probability greater than one

26
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:04,056
or a probability less than zero,

27
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:05,456
you'll laugh at them because we know

28
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:08,577
that probabilities can only
be between zero and one.

29
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:11,094
So I'm assuming you know stuff like that.

30
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:13,095
Anyway, here's sort of a definition

31
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:17,153
I always start out with in such a class,

32
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:20,441
and that is the definition
of conditional probability.

33
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:23,246
So the probability of some event A,

34
00:01:23,246 --> 00:01:26,410
given event B, is equal to the probability

35
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,078
of the intersection of
the two events A and B

36
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:31,820
divided by the probability
of B all by itself.

37
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,596
That's called the conditional
probability of A given B.

38
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,237
And this assumes that the probability of B

39
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:38,683
is greater than zero so you don't

40
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:42,346
run into these dividing
by zero type issues

41
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:44,284
but this is a very standard definition.

42
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:46,122
Now, if you don't like math,

43
00:01:46,122 --> 00:01:48,680
just think of it as the probability

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,468
that A is going to occur

45
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:53,801
given the updated information B,

46
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:55,961
and we'll do a couple
examples to show you.

47
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:56,980
This is certainly something

48
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,063
that we'll be using throughout the course.

49
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:02,072
So, what's the probability
that an event A happens

50
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:05,700
given that your friend has
told you that B has happened?

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,227
And this allows you to
update the probabilities.

52
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:10,849
Now for instance, what's the probability

53
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:12,925
that it's gonna rain today

54
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,550
given that it's rained
for the last four days?

55
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,587
That's probably not
equal to the probability

56
00:02:17,587 --> 00:02:21,372
it's gonna rain today, given
no information whatsoever.

57
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:23,615
Let's go through an example or two

58
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:26,112
and we can expand on this.

59
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,681
Let's toss a fair die.

60
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,626
I'm gonna define the event A

61
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:33,439
as having a one, two, or a three appear

62
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,566
and I'll define the event B

63
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:39,025
as having a three, four,
five, or six appear.

64
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,906
Then the probability of A given B

65
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:44,747
which means what's the
probability that I saw

66
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,040
a one or a two or a three

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,352
given that my friend secretly told me,

68
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:51,557
well, a three, four,
five, or six appeared,

69
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:52,933
but I'm not gonna tell you which one.

70
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:55,534
So what's the probability that
a one, two, three appeared

71
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:57,939
given that my friend has
already told me that,

72
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:00,318
well, a three, four,
five, or six has appeared?

73
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:02,516
Well, what's gonna happen here

74
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,687
is that my friend has eliminated

75
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:06,576
the possibility of one and two,

76
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:10,682
so the probability of A
intersect B in this case

77
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:14,217
is just the probability
that a three occurred,

78
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:16,064
which equals 1/6.

79
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:20,073
The probability of B all
by itself occurring is 4/6

80
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:22,693
and so even my cat can do this division.

81
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:27,453
1/6 over 4/6, the updated
probability of A occurring is 1/4.

82
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:29,901
So before we did the experiment

83
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,444
the probability of A
occurring all by itself,

84
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:33,995
the probability of getting
a one, two, or three,

85
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:34,939
that was 1/2.

86
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:37,191
But given that my friend has
told me this information,

87
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:39,171
that a three, four, five,
or six has occurred,

88
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:41,290
the updated probability of A occurring

89
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,467
unfortunately goes down to 1/4,

90
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:45,112
so there's lots of interesting problems

91
00:03:45,112 --> 00:03:46,101
that you can do.

92
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:50,001
On the homework I'll give you
one or two that you can enjoy.

93
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:51,295
Here's another definition.

94
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:53,616
If the probability of A intersect B

95
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:56,276
equals P of A times P of B,

96
00:03:56,276 --> 00:03:59,398
then A and B are called
independent events,

97
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:01,648
and I'll give some motivation for that.

98
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:04,243
For instance, if I'm interested

99
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:07,724
in looking at the temperature on Mars

100
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:10,359
and the IBM stock price,

101
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:12,660
it turns out that those are
gonna be independent events,

102
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,828
they have nothing to do with each other,

103
00:04:14,828 --> 00:04:17,405
and I'll show you where this
nothing to do with each other

104
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:19,217
motivation comes from in a second.

105
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,358
So, at least they would have you believe

106
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,083
that they have nothing
to do with each other.

107
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,876
Hopefully they are in fact independent.

108
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:27,674
Theorem, this is sort of the motivational

109
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:29,629
definition of independence.

110
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:31,150
If A and B are independent,

111
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,272
then the probability of A given B

112
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:35,760
equals the probability of A all by itself,

113
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,392
so this is not a
definition, it's a theorem,

114
00:04:38,392 --> 00:04:41,279
and it's kind of a nice theorem

115
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,733
that I sort of pretend is a definition.

116
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,878
What it means is the information

117
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:47,753
that my friend gives me about B

118
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:50,497
does not affect the
probability of A at all,

119
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:54,121
so the probability of A
occurring given that I know B,

120
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:56,210
that's just the probability
of A all by itself.

121
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,671
B has given no influence on
the probability of A occurring,

122
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:01,483
so that's why they're called independent,

123
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:03,077
B has nothin' to do with A.

124
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:05,477
Here's an example, let's toss two dice.

125
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:07,568
I'll let A equal the event

126
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:09,128
that the sum is a seven,

127
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:10,492
and B is gonna be the event

128
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:12,765
that the first die is a four.

129
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:15,331
A die is the singular version of dice,

130
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:16,695
I'm not being gross here.

131
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:19,859
So the probability of A is 1/6

132
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:22,060
because there are six ways
that you can get a seven.

133
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,545
You can get a one and a six,

134
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:26,040
you can get a two and a five, dot dot dot.

135
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,084
There's six ways you can do it,

136
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:29,873
six out of 36, and so that translates

137
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:31,742
to a probability of 1/6.

138
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:33,740
The probability of B occurring,

139
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,763
that the first die is a four,

140
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:37,856
well let's just look at the first die.

141
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:40,591
One, two, three, four, five, six,

142
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,562
one of those possibilities

143
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:44,349
is first die is a four,

144
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:46,367
so that probability is also 1/6,

145
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,769
Okay, meanwhile the
probability of A intersect B,

146
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:53,225
the only way that A can intersect B

147
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:56,076
if the sum is a seven and
the first die is a four,

148
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:59,235
that must be that the first die is a four

149
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:00,946
and the second die is a three,

150
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:03,362
that must be, it's the
only way to intersect,

151
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,215
and so that event, a four and a three,

152
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:09,075
has a probability of
1/36, which by coincidence

153
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:10,946
is probability of A
times probability of B,

154
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:13,684
1/6 times 1/6, and so it shows

155
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:16,210
that the two events in that case, A and B,

156
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,773
are independent of each
other, congratulations.

157
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:22,940
Let's jump over to the
definition of a random variable.

158
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:25,857
Don't be frightened by this

159
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:28,872
'cause there's a little
equation, it's nothing at all.

160
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:31,204
Random variable's just a function X

161
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:33,261
from the sample space of the experiment

162
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:34,370
to the real line.

163
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,452
I'll give an example to
show what I mean by that.

164
00:06:37,452 --> 00:06:39,916
Let X be the sum of two dice rolls.

165
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,485
So the sample space is all the
pairs of possible dice rolls.

166
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:46,924
One one, one two, dot dot
dot, all the way to six six.

167
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:48,745
What's that called, boxcars I guess?

168
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:51,662
So in particular, one set of tosses

169
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:55,087
could be a four and a six,

170
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:56,664
and that adds up to 10.

171
00:06:56,664 --> 00:07:00,581
So what happens, my
function X takes an element

172
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,560
of the sample space, four six,

173
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,727
and it moves it over to the real line.

174
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:10,662
So four six gets transformed
over to the real line.

175
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:13,350
In addition, the probability that x equals

176
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,116
any particular specific value,

177
00:07:16,116 --> 00:07:18,987
so capital X is the random thing,

178
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:21,341
little x is a specific value.

179
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,471
We know that the probability of the sum

180
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:26,044
of two dice tosses is,

181
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:29,216
if the sum is two the probability is 1/36,

182
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,508
there's only one way you can do it,

183
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:31,752
get a one and a one.

184
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:35,317
To get little x equal to
three, the sum equals three,

185
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:36,681
the only ways you can do that

186
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,246
are tossing a one and a two

187
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:41,180
or a two and a one, so that's 2/36.

188
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,374
And so you can see you get this,

189
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:45,288
what's called a probability mass function.

190
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:47,569
1/36, 2/36, it goes all the way up

191
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:50,037
to 6/36 when x equals seven,

192
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:54,577
then it comes back down
to 1/36 for x equals 12.

193
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:58,601
That brings to mind a general
class of random variables,

194
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:01,602
or I call 'em recreational
variables sometimes.

195
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:04,684
So the definition I'm aiming at here is,

196
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,500
if the number of possible values,

197
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,955
of our random variable X,

198
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,478
is finite or countably infinite,

199
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:12,197
and in that last example it was finite,

200
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:16,258
there were 12, there were 11
values, x equals two to 12.

201
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:19,277
Then X is called a
discrete random variable.

202
00:08:19,277 --> 00:08:22,182
Its probability mass function, or pmf,

203
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:24,014
is given by little f of x,

204
00:08:24,014 --> 00:08:27,137
that's a function of
x, and it's defined as

205
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,678
the probability that X equals any of these

206
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:32,355
finite or countably infinite x values,

207
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:35,825
and note that they add up to
one, all these probabilities.

208
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:38,999
The sum of x over little
f of x equals one.

209
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:40,263
By countably infinite I mean

210
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:42,654
there could be an infinite
number of these things,

211
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:45,151
but they have a one to one
correspondence with the integers,

212
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,803
that's what countably infinite means.

213
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:50,322
Example, let's flip two coins,
X is the number of heads.

214
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:53,175
X can only equal zero, one, or two,

215
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:55,579
so the probability that
I flip the two coins

216
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:58,850
and get zero heads is 1/4,

217
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,385
the probability that I
get two heads, also 1/4.

218
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:03,580
And the probability that
I get exactly one head,

219
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,225
so I either get heads
tails or tails heads,

220
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:08,029
that's equal to 1/2.

221
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:10,840
And there's no other
possible values for X.

222
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,600
1.5, not possible, negative
three, not possible.

223
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,694
So if you add up all those numbers,

224
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:19,484
1/4 plus 1/4 plus 1/2,

225
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:21,547
wow, magic, it's equal to one.

226
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:23,861
And we have a bunch of other

227
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:25,522
discrete random variables you may remember

228
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:28,494
from Baby Stats class,
Bernoulli random variable,

229
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:30,185
Binomial, Geometric, Poissin,

230
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:32,361
I'll talk about all those as we need them,

231
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:34,565
so don't panic if you don't remember.

232
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:36,184
Now, the other class of random variables

233
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:38,004
that we're interested in

234
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:40,259
are what's called
continuous random variables.

235
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:41,777
A continues random variable is one

236
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:45,129
that has probability zero
at every individual point,

237
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,110
and in this case there exists

238
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,901
what's called a probability
density function, or pdf.

239
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:53,370
F of x having the magical property

240
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,298
that, well, f of x is not a probability

241
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:58,331
like it was for the
probability mass function,

242
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,532
but you can get
probabilities from the pdf.

243
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:03,468
And namely, here's how you do it.

244
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:06,395
If A is any set or any event,

245
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:09,762
then the probability
that X falls in that set

246
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:13,829
is merely the integral of
f of x taken over that set,

247
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:18,131
and so f of x, the pdf
is not a probability,

248
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:19,818
but it gets you the probabilities.

249
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:21,333
People mess that up all the time,

250
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,759
but that's what it is,

251
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,206
and note that if I integrate f of x

252
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:28,098
over the entire real line,
that integrates to one.

253
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:30,759
That's kinda like adding up
the pmf and getting a one.

254
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,260
So here's the simplest
example I could think of.

255
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,195
Just pick a random real number
between three and seven.

256
00:10:36,195 --> 00:10:38,303
There are an infinite number

257
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:40,673
of real numbers between three and seven,

258
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,731
and in fact, it's uncountably infinite,

259
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:46,530
which is a bigger infinity
than countably infinite,

260
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,674
believe it or not.

261
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:49,288
So, the probability that I pick

262
00:10:49,288 --> 00:10:51,812
any individual value
between three and seven,

263
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:54,620
like suppose, what's a
probability that I pick a five,

264
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,631
that probability is zero,

265
00:10:56,631 --> 00:11:00,798
'cause I could have easily
picked 5.00001 or 4.99999

266
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:04,219
so the probability of any
individual number is zero,

267
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:06,697
that kinda corresponds to the integral

268
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:09,716
of a continuous function over one point.

269
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:14,524
So, even though f of x is not
the probability of the event,

270
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:18,100
it's the pdf, which gives me the ability

271
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,723
to calculate probabilities,
and for purposes of this,

272
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:25,160
what's called uniform distribution
between three and seven,

273
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,573
the pdf is equal to 1/4 for
x between three and seven,

274
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:32,311
and notice if you integrate
1/4 from three to seven

275
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:35,081
that gives you a one, so
things kinda make sense.

276
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:37,776
Now, some famous continuous
random variables,

277
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:39,787
which you've heard of, are Uniform,

278
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:41,948
Exponential, and Normal, or Gaussian,

279
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:43,553
we'll talk more about those later.

280
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:46,354
For now, I'm very, very lazy,

281
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:48,108
I'm gonna use that little twiddle thing,

282
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,256
that means is distributed as.

283
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:52,547
I don't like writin'
things out, save some ink.

284
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:56,028
So if I write x twiddle Uniform 0.1,

285
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:58,289
that means that X has
the uniform distribution

286
00:11:58,289 --> 00:11:59,344
from zero to one.

287
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,142
Now, I'll give one more definition

288
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:04,933
for any random variable, x
either discrete or continuous,

289
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,068
the cumulative distribution
function, or cdf,

290
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,619
is the probability of
everything that's happened

291
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:12,292
up to little x.

292
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:14,686
So capital F of x is the probability

293
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:16,897
that capital X is less than or equal

294
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:18,843
to the particular value little x.

295
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:22,132
Capital X is random, little
x is a specific value,

296
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:24,081
and the thing on the right-hand side

297
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:27,351
is basically the integral
from minus infinity

298
00:12:27,351 --> 00:12:29,646
to x of little f of y dy,

299
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:32,350
so everything that's
happened up to time x,

300
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,071
that's if X is continuous.

301
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:35,494
The reason I'm using little y,

302
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:37,064
is it's just a dummy variable,

303
00:12:37,064 --> 00:12:38,660
and it's the same thing with the summation

304
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,453
effects as a discrete random variable.

305
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:42,795
Notice that capital F of x,

306
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,199
when you let x go to
minus infinity it's zero,

307
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,409
because the probability of x

308
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:50,137
being less than minus infinity is zero.

309
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,813
Similarly, the probability that X

310
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,231
is less than infinity is one,

311
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,903
and the nice thing is, if X is continuous

312
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:59,969
you take the derivative of
big X, you get little f.

313
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:02,931
Uh, take the derivative of
big F, you get little f,

314
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:06,428
and vice versa, integrate
little f, you get big F,

315
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:08,995
that's by fundamental theorem of Calculus.

316
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,698
Example, flip two coins.

317
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:11,800
Number of heads?

318
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,337
Well remember the probability

319
00:13:13,337 --> 00:13:16,818
that we would get zero heads is 1/4,

320
00:13:16,818 --> 00:13:19,555
so nothing happens until
you get x equal to zero,

321
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:21,469
that's why there's a
zero on the first line

322
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,162
and 1/4 on the second line.

323
00:13:23,162 --> 00:13:24,845
Then nothing happens

324
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,179
until you get to x equals one,

325
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:30,795
whereupon the probability
that x equals one is 1/2

326
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:32,815
so the cumulative probability goes from

327
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:35,414
1/4 plus 1/2 to 3/4,

328
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:39,021
and then nothing happens
until you get to x equals two,

329
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:41,537
whereupon the cdf jumps up to one

330
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:44,548
because 3/4 plus the
probability that x equals two,

331
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:46,501
which is 1/4, that equals one.

332
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,854
In the continuous case, let's pretend

333
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:51,853
x has the exponential lambda distribution.

334
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:54,363
This is the old friend
that I reminded you about

335
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:56,409
a slide or so ago, that just means

336
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:59,465
that little f of x is
lambda elim minus lambda x,

337
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:01,051
that is by definition,

338
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:02,934
and that's for x greater than zero.

339
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:05,497
Well, if you integrate
that thing from zero to x,

340
00:14:05,497 --> 00:14:06,634
because you don't need to worry

341
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:09,483
about anything below x equals zero,

342
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:11,772
if you integrate that from zero to x

343
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:13,580
it turns out with elementary Calculus

344
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,636
that capital F of x is equal to one

345
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:17,573
minus elim minus lambda x.

346
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:19,608
We'll go through this again
in more detail later on

347
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,967
'cause it's a very important distribution.

348
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:24,758
