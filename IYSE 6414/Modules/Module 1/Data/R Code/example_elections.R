# I would say that the line appears to be curvilinear and therefore

##Is the Palm Beach vote count an anomaly?

## Omit Palm Beach
model.red = lm(log(buch[-50])~log(bush[-50]))
summary(model.red)

# 
# The slope and intercept term both change.
# In the model dropping PB the intercept is higher.
# Hoever the confidence intervals overlap => no real change in slope.
# Residuals are similar. QQ plot slightly better. The large negative resid is gone
# removing some of the skew in the distribution.

## Obtain the predicted vote count for Palm Beach given the fitted model without
new = data.frame(bush = bush[50])
## The difference between predicted on the original scale and the observed vote count

## Prediction Confidence Interval for log(vote count)
